And finally, describe the principles of overload, SAID, and reversibility. Here's our patient case that'll be used for this lecture. On general physical examination, J.D a 14-year-old has an obese appearance and presents with difficulty in standing, walking, getting up from sitting positions, and climbing stairs. He also presents with proximal weakness, calf hypertrophy, hamstring muscle contracture, and a positive Gower's sign. So you've determined that this patient is appropriate for resistance training. So what do you do? Well, first, let's understand what resistance training actually is.  Resistance training is a form of active exercise in which dynamic or static muscle contractions resist an outside force applied manually or  mechanically.  Now, since we have established what the definition is, I would like to say before we do anything else that resists training within the literature is heavily, heavily covered. As a matter of fact, it is so ubiquitous that it's hardly worth mentioning the fact that, yes, there is literature supporting resistance training. As a matter of fact, when I did a very quick search term for resistance training and rehabilitation, I had almost 44,000 hits. So again, when we go through the material associated with resistance training, it's assuming that we all understand that resistance training does have therapeutic benefits.  Okay, so let's talk about some of the elements of muscle performance, and they are strength, endurance, and power. The strength of a muscle is the ability of contractile tissue to produce tension and resultant force based on the demands placed on the muscle. So when we say strength training for muscle, we're really speaking to strength training to be used to increase the force production of muscle. The endurance of muscle is the ability to perform low-intensity, repetitive or sustained activities over a prolonged period of time. And we use indirect endurance training to increase tolerance to repetitive loads from many repetitions over a long period of time.  And to note, this is not aerobic endurance, this is muscle endurance. And finally, power. Power is related to strength and speed of movement. And is defined as work, which is force multiply that by the distance, and produced by muscle per unit of time, which is force multiplied by the distance divided by time. In other words, muscle power is the rate of performing work. The rate at which a muscle produces a force and the relationship between force and velocity are key factors that affect muscle power. Now, strength and endurance principles are associated as elements of muscle performance, but they are not always correlated. Power can be associated with both strength and endurance characteristics of muscles, notably. So let's give an example. So we have our patient, and they may be able to lift 30 pounds a couple times at once, and this really refers to their strength. But they may not have the ability to lift that same load 100 times the day, and that we consider endurance. So for power, because work can be produced over a brief period or very long period of time, power can represent a single burst of high intensity activity. So for example, coming up quickly from a chair, or repeated bursts of less intense activity, let's say climbing a stairwell. However, while power could have qualities of both strength and  endurance, explosive functional movement is a hallmark characteristic of power. So let's bring this back to JD. So JD can lift a 10-pound weight, 5 feet off the ground ten times in 1 minute. This effectively gives us our values for work, time, and power. Where work in joules is lifting a 10 pound weight, 5 feet off the ground ten times, and the time is 1 minute. Using these particular values, we can discover what the power associate activity is. However, with assessment, you find that JD cannot lift a 20 pound weight, 5 feet off the ground in 1 minute. In other words, the patient cannot work at the designated rate of power. Now, physical therapy could develop exercise that increase the capacity for the rate of work or power of the patient through resistance training. Now, in order to achieve these functional goals through resistive training, there are some guiding principles of exercise we must understand. And that is the overload principle, the SAID principle, and the reversibility principle. The overload principle is the principle that a muscle must be challenged to perform at a level greater than that to which it is accustomed, okay? So in other words, if you have someone that wants to train to do some  sort of activity but they're not used to that magnitude or intensity of exercise, they must expose their body to a similar intensity for their body to be able to perform at the level they would like to perform at. The SAID principle is associated with mechanotransduction. Well, the SAID principle stands for Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demand. In other words, it's the body's adaptation to the stresses that's put on it. It changes in response to what we want to do or what we're training to do. So for example, with the overload principle, we are overloading our muscle tissue with activities it's not used to. The body then using the SAID principle will change depending on those forces that are put on it. And finally, there is the reversibility principle. And this is associated with detraining. And it's a reduction in muscle performance as a result of cessation of resistance training. So if we were to, let's say, train for an event, and then after that period of event where our muscles did hypertrophy, they got stronger, showed more endurance or power, we did nothing or less intensity. What's going to happen is that muscle is going to effectively lose those physiological aspects which allowed for that level muscle performance. It'll get weaker, it won't have the same endurance, and we'll have the  same power generation capability. Now, every muscle tissue has different thresholds for overuse. And this is generally determined by the ability of the muscle to generate tension. So we need to start considering the characteristics of muscle that affect force generation. And we'll speak more of this in our lecture, muscle adaptations to resistance exercise.  So our takeaways from this lecture. Resistance training is a form of active exercise in which dynamic or static muscle contractions are resisted by an outside force applied manually or mechanically. Strength is the ability of contractile tissue to produce tension and resultant force based on the demands placed on the muscle. Endurance is the ability to perform low-intensity repetitive or sustained activities over a prolonged period of time. And work is the power produced by muscle per unit of time. The overload, SAID, and reversibility principles guide how we formulate resistance training exercise prescription.  And this concludes our lecture on the principles of resistance exercise.  If you have any questions, please reach out to me or Dr Stern. Otherwise, thank you, and speak at you next time.  \", metadata={})"

       "[Document(page_content=\"6.1 Principles of Resistance Exercise Hello, and welcome to our lecture on the principles of resistance exercise. Here is our course statement. By the end of this lecture, I am hoping that you'll be able to define resistance training, define the following terms associated with resistance training, and they include resistance training, muscle strength, power, and endurance. And finally, describe the principles of overload, SAID, and reversibility. Here's our patient case that'll be used for this lecture. On general physical examination, J.D a 14-year-old has an obese appearance and presents with difficulty in standing, walking, getting up from sitting positions, and climbing stairs. He also presents with proximal weakness, calf hypertrophy, hamstring muscle contracture, and a positive Gower's sign. So you've determined that this patient is appropriate for resistance training. So what do you do? Well, first, let's understand what resistance training actually is.  Resistance training is a form of active exercise in which dynamic or static muscle contractions resist an outside force applied manually or  mechanically.  Now, since we have established what the definition is, I would like to say before we do anything else that resists training within the literature is heavily, heavily covered. As a matter of fact, it is so ubiquitous that it's hardly worth mentioning the fact that, yes, there is literature supporting resistance training. As a matter of fact, when I did a very quick search term for resistance training and rehabilitation, I had almost 44,000 hits. So again, when we go through the material associated with resistance training, it's assuming that we all understand that resistance training does have therapeutic benefits.  Okay, so let's talk about some of the elements of muscle performance, and they are strength, endurance, and power. The strength of a muscle is the ability of contractile tissue to produce tension and resultant force based on the demands placed on the muscle. So when we say strength training for muscle, we're really speaking to strength training to be used to increase the force production of muscle. The endurance of muscle is the ability to perform low-intensity, repetitive or sustained activities over a prolonged period of time. And we use indirect endurance training to increase tolerance to repetitive loads from many repetitions over a long period of time.  And to note, this is not aerobic endurance, this is muscle endurance. And finally, power. Power is related to strength and speed of movement. And is defined as work, which is force multiply that by the distance, and produced by muscle per unit of time, which is force multiplied by the distance divided by time. In other words, muscle power is the rate of performing work. The rate at which a muscle produces a force and the relationship between force and velocity are key factors that affect muscle power. Now, strength and endurance principles are associated as elements of muscle performance, but they are not always correlated. Power can be associated with both strength and endurance characteristics of muscles, notably. So let's give an example. So we have our patient, and they may be able to lift 30 pounds a couple times at once, and this really refers to their strength. But they may not have the ability to lift that same load 100 times the day, and that we consider endurance. So for power, because work can be produced over a brief period or very long period of time, power can represent a single burst of high intensity activity. So for example, coming up quickly from a chair, or repeated bursts of less intense activity, let's say climbing a stairwell. However, while power could have qualities of both strength and  endurance, explosive functional movement is a hallmark characteristic of power. So let's bring this back to JD. So JD can lift a 10-pound weight, 5 feet off the ground ten times in 1 minute. This effectively gives us our values for work, time, and power. Where work in joules is lifting a 10 pound weight, 5 feet off the ground ten times, and the time is 1 minute. Using these particular values, we can discover what the power associate activity is. However, with assessment, you find that JD cannot lift a 20 pound weight, 5 feet off the ground in 1 minute. In other words, the patient cannot work at the designated rate of power. Now, physical therapy could develop exercise that increase the capacity for the rate of work or power of the patient through resistance training. Now, in order to achieve these functional goals through resistive training, there are some guiding principles of exercise we must understand. And that is the overload principle, the SAID principle, and the reversibility principle. The overload principle is the principle that a muscle must be challenged to perform at a level greater than that to which it is accustomed, okay? So in other words, if you have someone that wants to train to do some  sort of activity but they're not used to that magnitude or intensity of exercise, they must expose their body to a similar intensity for their body to be able to perform at the level they would like to perform at. The SAID principle is associated with mechanotransduction. Well, the SAID principle stands for Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demand. In other words, it's the body's adaptation to the stresses that's put on it. It changes in response to what we want to do or what we're training to do. So for example, with the overload principle, we are overloading our muscle tissue with activities it's not used to. The body then using the SAID principle will change depending on those forces that are put on it. And finally, there is the reversibility principle. And this is associated with detraining. And it's a reduction in muscle performance as a result of cessation of resistance training. So if we were to, let's say, train for an event, and then after that period of event where our muscles did hypertrophy, they got stronger, showed more endurance or power, we did nothing or less intensity. What's going to happen is that muscle is going to effectively lose those physiological aspects which allowed for that level muscle performance. It'll get weaker, it won't have the same endurance, and we'll have the  same power generation capability. Now, every muscle tissue has different thresholds for overuse. And this is generally determined by the ability of the muscle to generate tension. So we need to start considering the characteristics of muscle that affect force generation. And we'll speak more of this in our lecture, muscle adaptations to resistance exercise.  So our takeaways from this lecture. Resistance training is a form of active exercise in which dynamic or static muscle contractions are resisted by an outside force applied manually or mechanically. Strength is the ability of contractile tissue to produce tension and resultant force based on the demands placed on the muscle. Endurance is the ability to perform low-intensity repetitive or sustained activities over a prolonged period of time. And work is the power produced by muscle per unit of time. The overload, SAID, and reversibility principles guide how we formulate resistance training exercise prescription.  And this concludes our lecture on the principles of resistance exercise.  If you have any questions, please reach out to me or Dr Stern. Otherwise, thank you, and speak at you next time.\", metadata={}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"6.4 Framework for Resistance TrainingHello and welcome to our lecture on a framework for resistance exercise. Here's our course statement. But in this lecture, I'm hoping that you'll be able to describe the principles of progressive overload set and general adaptation syndrome. Discuss basic concepts and context of exercise dosing and physical rehabilitation. As well as explain baseline foundational theoretical strategies to create and or modify prescribed exercise plan.  Now the clinical case for this lecture, we will be using other lectures included in this series of lectures. I'm going to read this once, and I will not read it again, but here it is. J.K is a 63-year-old male that comes to your clinic with reports of chronic back pain. He states that his physician has asked him to exercise at the gym. He has been given general guidelines from his physician, but isn't sure how to manage his back pain while also preventing further injuries. So what questions would you want to ask the patient regarding exercise?  How might you determine how many repetitions or how much weight the patient should use? And what factors should be considered when choosing an exercise plan of care? Well, I'm hoping that this lecture series on exercise prescription for resistance training will help answer these questions for you. But in with regards to this particular case, please refer to box 6.6 and 6.10 of the book. Again, the book is going to be the basis for much of this content, and I would like to review the content that is required reading as you prepare for assessment.  Now let's dive into some of the basic principles associated with the resistance exercise.  According to the American College of Sports Medicine, a comprehensive program of exercise must be built for individuals with chronic disease or disability. And modifications to these exercise programs should include special consideration for the patient's habitual physical activity, physical function, their current health status as well as exercise response and stated goals. Periodically, the American College of Sports Medicine will release position stands on the guidance for prescribing exercise. In this particular case in 2011, a report was released by them discussing the strategies used for maintaining cardio respiratory muscle skeletal and neuromotor fitness, and apparently healthy adults.  Now with regards to this approach, to building a comprehensive program that is holistic. This is absolutely going to be the case for JK, given that he is suffering from a chronic disease or a certain level of disability that requires specialized care. But again, where do we start? What foundational theory do we utilize in order to build contexts for exercise prescription.  So there are three different concepts, I would like to use to conceptualize the impact of exercise on a person. The first is the SAID principle, which is specific adaptations to impose demands. And effectively what this means is that the body will specifically adapt to the types of demands placed on it or stresses. So for example, in individuals that are sedentary, let's say sit for long periods of time, their body will start to change and adapt to the demands of sitting. Now the next concept is progressive overload according to ACSM. The progressive overload states that to enhance muscular fitness you must exercise a level beyond the point to which your muscles are accustomed. The three ways to progress the overload in resistance training are to increase the number of repetitions, increase the number of sets for a given muscle group, as well as increase the resistance used for that muscle group.  Finally, the general adaptation syndrome, also called GAS, describes the process your body goes through when you are exposed to any kind of stress, whether it be positive, or negative. Now, this syndrome has three stages. The alarm stage, the resistance stage, and the exhaustion stage. Now if you do not resolve or account for the stress that has triggered this process, it can lead to physical and mental health problems. Now here's the overall progression of these stages of GAS. The first is the alarm reaction where the body adapts to changes in homeostasis and response to a stimulus. If that stress continues to be applied, this stress can lead to physiological changes which could either be healing changes, rehabilitate changes, or if the stress does continue can lead to a stage of exhaustion, which is where stress overwhelms physiological healing and trauma. What this speaks to is moderation of forces. We are going to have an alarm reaction every single time that we complete overload exercises where the body is going to adapt to changes in homeostasis, such as lows being placed on tissue. And if done correctly, that stress can lead to positive physiological changes or healing, if that stress exceeds this stage of resistance it leads to damage. Well, that might present as a stage of exhaustion, where the stress overwhelms the physiological healing processes, and it stays in a chronic state of inflammation.   So many of the chronic diseases such as in our patient with lower back pain, and those seen in contemporary Western society are manifestations of the Stage of Exhaustion. In which the tissue or system has become overly fatigued and or lost its ability to adapt to the stresses regularly placed upon it and this speaks directly to overuse syndromes and this is a quote taken from Hoover et al, in 2015.  So with consideration to our lecture case, let's say that JK has to lift 50 pounds throughout the day as part of their job, and they have no regular training regimen. What parameters do we consider to be a part of their exercise regimen. And with regards to the principles we just covered, how do we find that moderation whereby stresses applied to the tissue one, cause overload and consequently lead to adaptation of the tissue but also be considered healthy? A healing component rehabilitation effect as predicated by the GAS principle. Well, we are going to discuss some of these parameters in these lecture series, and they are covered here on the left side as far as what we will go through. However, some of the parameters we will not discuss and this is where I really would like you to delve into the two or our required readings for the course. Now to note, rest time per the ACSM increases should be no more than 2.5 or 5% per week to avoid over training and that really refers to repetitions and duration. So it's a way to moderate how quickly you are going to progress exercises while allowing enough time for the body to recover.  Now as far as body position what that speaks to is, can be the alignment, but examples of that would be gravity eliminated positions of exercise or open or closed chain exercises which you've already spoken to.  So our takeaways, the framework for therapeutic exercise prescription incorporates a wholesome process that has built on science led, patient centered care, and projected impact on the patient. GAS is the synthesis of subjective presentation and physiological knowledge associated with the effects of movement on a system. It lays the foundation for exercise prescription and how we physiologically measure tissue healing. And as I mentioned earlier in this lecture, please review box 6.6 and 6.2 in your required readings to prepare for course assessments. This concludes our lecture on a framework for resistance exercise. If you have any questions, please reach out to me or Dr. Stern. Otherwise, thank you and speak catch you next time.\", metadata={}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"6.9 Precautions and Contraindications for Resistance ExerciseWelcome to our lecture on the precautions and contraindications for resistance exercise. Here's our course statement. But in this lecture, I'm hoping to be able to list, and remember, the precautions and contraindications to resistance exercise.  So theory in practice. A lot goes into exercise dosing, as I'm sure you can appreciate now as we've gone through this lecture series on exercise prescription for resistance training. There is one component of exercise that we're always taking into consideration, and that is the safety of the patient. How do we use patient specific information and evidence in the literature and critical thinking in order to best serve our patients? The culmination of application of the general adaptation syndrome, the said principle, met principles, specificity of function, the rate of perceived exertion and other biometrics we measure. As well as a fully functional testing algorithms, all manifest in our ability to provide safe exercise dosing, while still meeting our functional goals for the patient.  As part of your effective exercise program, it can include interventional methods, including range of motion, which helps minimize physiological changes in bone and tissue and prepare a body for movement.  It can include stretching, which helps maintain or improve joint and tissue mobility or integrity. And finally, it can also include manually resisted exercises which will help improve strength, endurance, and stability, while also enhancing neuromuscular control. Now, as with any of our aforementioned interventions, resistance exercise does have precautions. The three primary precautions include valsalva maneuver to substitute motions and overtraining. Valsalva maneuver refers to when a patient holds their breath during exertion. To avoid use of the valsalva maneuver, the patient is encouraged to not hold their breath or an exercise. Patients that have undergone surgery, have cardiovascular disease or some sort of cerebral vascular injury are more at risk for complications associated with the valsalva maneuver. Substitute motions also known as compensatory movements are likely to occur in extremely weak muscles. And we avoid these compensations by matching the resistance of an exercise to the ability of the person. And of course, as the person is completing the exercise, we need to be able to provide appropriate stabilization, whether that be with the use of passive support or active support coming from another person. And the last precaution is overtraining. Overwork and concurrent decreases in strength are result from long-term overuse of already weak muscles.  And this has been reported in patients with non-progressive neurological conditions such as post-polio syndrome and beyond brace syndrome. Some other precautions for resistance exercise, including soreness and fractures. Exercise induced muscle soreness, also known as acute soreness, and delayed onset muscle soreness are two different presentations of exercise related inflammatory processes that indicate the healing phases occurring within the tissue. Acute soreness refers to burning and aching due to immediate fatigue and delayed onset muscle soreness also called domes occurs 12 to 24 hours after exercise. And a key strategy in avoiding these types of presentation and muscle soreness, is a program that is gradually progressed in order to avoid overuse and to minimize the risk for injury in the soft tissue. Another precaution is pathological fractures. And as a means to avoid the complications associated exercise and fractures, you need to know the patient's history and whether or not they're at risk for fracture. As you prepare for your assessment, please see box 613 in your textbook. Now as far as the contraindications for resistance to exercise, they include pain, inflammation and severe presentations of cardiopulmonary disease. If someone is experiencing pain at the joint or muscle, start an active range of motion. We are not going to be applying resistance.   If the person has acute muscle pain during resisted isometrics, we are not applying resistance. And when pain that doesn't stop with resistance is reduced, we are stopping the exercise. With regards to inflammation, dynamic and static resistance are contraindicated with acute inflammatory neuromuscular diseases. And if there is a cute joint inflammation, no dynamic resistance exercises should be completed.  With severe cardiopulmonary disease, severe or uncontrolled coronary artery disease, cardiac myopathy, myocarditis, congestive heart failure, hypertension, and dysrhythmias that are uncontrolled are considered to be contraindications. You're going to wait until five weeks after a myocardial . And you're going to wait until five weeks after a myocardial infarction or cabbage and when you receive a physician's clearance for a patient to return to physical therapy before you incorporate resistance training.  So as far as your precautions and education takeaways, please know your precautions and indications for resistance training.  This concludes our lecture on precautions and contraindications for resistance exercise.  As always, if you have any questions please reach out to me or Dr Stern, otherwise thank you and speak at your next time.\", metadata={}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"6.8 Order and Frequency of Resistance ExerciseHello and welcome to our lecture on the order and frequency of resistance exercise. Here's our core statement.  By the end of this lecture I'm hoping to be able to offer suggestions regarding the order and frequency of strength training based on ACM guidelines, as well as concepts of periodization. And finally, consider patient specific factors as they relate to determining best practice in the order and frequency of strength training. According to the ACSM or the American College of Sports Medicine, there is a standard guideline for how we go about prescribing exercises to promote strength.  The first recommendation is that you will be training major muscle groups first. The second is that you will train two to three days per week. The third is that you'll perform 8-12 repetitions of that exercise to fatigue but not to failure. The fourth point is that you use a 10-point BORG RPE scale which is a modified scale to the one we had mentioned in another lecture whereby the patient is exerting a moderate intensity which is five to six or at vigorous intensity of seven to eight. And the fifth suggestion is that the exercise should have an adjusted resistance to about 60 to 80% of their one rep max.  Now as a clinical note older clients should begin at a lower intensity of about 5 to 6 on a 10 point BORG RPE scale with 10 to 15 repetitions per set initially, and this is progressing to 8 to 12 reps. Now recall that these guidelines are a general rule. Please use specific means to determine beginning loads and using methods like  Holton as well as a patient's tolerance and clinical presentation to help guide your exercise prescription.  Now, in response to ACSM's guidelines, Braith et al in 1993 stated that the amount of time allotted and intensity of effort should be carefully gauged for both the cardiorespiratory and muscular strength and endurance components of the program. Additionally, they highlighted limitations of 1-rep max and lack of information on establishing a plan of care for patients in rehabilitation. And this really speaks to patients that are at high risk for complications associated with resistance training.  So with this we have to start considering patient specific parameters to help guide us in the overall formatting of our resistance exercise program. And one concept that we can use in order to help best organize our regimen is periodization. Periodization is a program manipulation of training variables throughout a training cycle. So periodization is an exercise technique that promotes long-term  performance improvements. It's basically a manipulation of the order and frequency of exercise to attain certain functional goals. The clinician, that is you, will thereby modify the intensity, volume, frequency, and specificity in exercise during certain training periods or cycles. For physical therapists, this might mean having a phase of exercise where we promote tissue healing and proprioceptive control followed by a period of stabilization increased functional range of motion. For the rehabilitative specialist, these phases will be heavily predicated by the patient stage of healing, the response to interventions and of course, their medical presentation at that point in time. Now notably periodization is commonly seen in athletes and designed around competition seasons with performance peaking at the most competitive times in the season. However, this can be modified to fit rehabilitation clinical programs. In standard practice, the periodization program is broken up into three primary cycles. They are micro cycles, meso cycles and macro cycles. Microcycles are the shortest cycle where most of the exercise variation takes place. And this is where there's a focus on daily or weekly training variations. And this is going to be heavily dependent on what the patient is presenting with that day.  The mesocycle usually depends on goals that you set for your patient care such as pain management or learning to turn over in bed. But programming goals will vary each mesocycle to help optimize performance. And the microcycle is typically one rehabilitative plan of care where the end goal is to peak around the end for optimal performance for return to function. Now I know that that's already been inferred but these cycles will vary depending on your goals for the patient and of course the patient's goals for rehabilitation. Now, this will look very different for athletes during which their training can last months or years. Now, here are some examples to consider for the phases or goals of periodization. You may have a muscle endurance phase where you have sustained long-term repetitions in your exercises. And you are using low to moderate intensity using RPEs to justify that you're meeting the therapeutic outcomes associated with your endurance related muscle characteristics. You may have a strength phase where you're having the patient work at 80 to 90% of their one rep maximum for exercises. However this is going to be more associated with later stages of healing.  Or you may have a maintenance phase. And this is where you have the patient perform strength or endurance  exercises, where they are exercising at moderate intensities, so around 75 to 80% of their one rep max. Or if they're incredibly deconditioned, performing exercises where they fatigue around six to eight repetitions of a functional movement. The clinical interpretation of periodization is that you train stuff on different days in order to meet certain therapeutic goals set by you or the patient.  So the underlying application of periodization is actually based on Selye's General Adaptation Syndrome and modified by John Garhammer in 1979 that can be used for rehabilitative medicine. In effect, the phases of gas are modified to fit specific functional goals on tissue adaptation. The first step is the initial training process. So that's the shock, and alarm phase. We have the recent resistance phase which looks at neuromuscular changes such as stabilization. And then we have super compensation phases where we look at muscular adaptations, such as strength or endurance. But all the time, we are trying to avoid moving into the stage of exhaustion, which is indicative of overtraining or re injury. So here is our case that I would like you to consider before we move on to the next slide.   So with regards to dosing, I would like to say that research is limited and it really primarily focuses on healthy and deconditioned clients or patients. It does not necessarily deal with the patient who has significant medical issues. So how does the concepts we cover today apply to recovering patients like JK? Now consider that strength training data is often based on one repetition maximum. Is this appropriate for JK? Many research articles utilize gravity limited treadmills, free weights or cable machines as part of the protocol, do all clients or patients have access to this equipment? And how might we use periodization in order to plan our plan of care to meet JK's goals? Now I'm not going to answer these questions, but these are things for you to think about and expect to speak to these questions during our next  session.  So our takeaways, ACSM guidelines offer a reference point for both the order and frequency of strength training exercises. And next, careful attention should be paid to the clinical presentation of the patient at the time of exercise prescription. And we can utilize concepts like periodization to effectively build a program that meets the patient and therapist-specific goals for a functional return.   This concludes our lecture on order and frequency of resistance exercise. If you have any questions, please reach out to me or Dr. Stern.
