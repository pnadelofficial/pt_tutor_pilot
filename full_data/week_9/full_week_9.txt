9.1 Review of SystemsEffects00:00:00[MUSIC] 00:00:09Okay, so lecture 9.1, review of systems. 00:00:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:20So our objectives for this series of lectures includes describing how the review of systems differs from a systems review. 00:00:30Describing strategies for determining whether a yes and answer to any checklist item is flagged and warrants physician contact. 00:00:38And then number 3 is you should be able to describe strategies to integrate the review of systems checklists efficiently into a patient examination scheme. 00:00:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:53Review of systems, the review of systems provides information about all major body systems. 00:00:59And also allows us to discover whether or not the symptoms suggest a need for referral. 00:01:06Finally, we can incorporate a checklist of symptoms associated  or not the symptoms suggest a need for referral. 00:01:06Finally, we can incorporate a checklist of symptoms associated with each body system to identify any unusual symptoms. 00:01:14So the systematic review of each body system provided by the review of systems can reveal symptoms related to the reason the patient is coming to see the physical therapist. 00:01:26For example, in a patient being seen for back and leg symptoms, who also complains of urinary dysfunction or settled DISAStasia. 00:01:35This combination would raise concern about the possible presence of cauda equina syndrome. 00:01:40Equally important, the checklist may identify symptoms that are unrelated to the patient's chief presenting complaint. 00:01:47But may be associated with one or more existing comorbid conditions, a disease, or adverse drug reactions. 00:01:54Detecting these symptoms would prompt contact with the appropriate healthcare provider. 00:01:59[ :03:04However, in addition to minor self-limiting conditions, the skin serves as a barometer for overall health because it often exhibits changes occurring in response to serious underlying systemic problems. 00:03:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:18Follow-up questions for the integumentary system include the onset and progression of skin changes. 00:03:28What exacerbates or relieves the problem, if anything? 00:03:31How has it changed over time? 00:03:33Are there any associated symptoms? 00:03:36The onset and progression of the skin change should be noted. 00:03:40Anything the patient believes may trigger, exacerbate, or relieve the problem should be noted. 00:03:45Inquire about how it may have changed since it was first noticed and all associated symptoms, such as itching, fatigue, and so on. 00:03:53[BLANK_AUDIO].  associated symptoms, such as itching, fatigue, and so on. 00:03:53[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:03:57Additional integumentary follow-up questions regarding skin complaints. 00:04:05Inquire about the presence of dryness or itchiness. 00:04:09Are there any new sores, rashes or lumps, any new odor or changes in perspiration? 00:04:15Any changes in warts, moles or lesions that bleed and do not heal? 00:04:19Any change in skin color or texture. 00:04:22Note that there are many medications which can affect the skin. 00:04:25When a patient has a skin complaint, it's important to include a wide range of other integumentary symptoms in the review of symptoms. 00:04:33Sorry, in the review of systems. 00:04:35For instance, ask the patient about the following, dry 33Sorry, in the review of systems. 00:04:35For instance, ask the patient about the following, dryness, pruritus, sores, rashes, lumps, unusual odor or perspiration, changes in warts or moles. 00:04:45Lesions that bleed and don't heal, or areas of chronic irritation. 00:04:48Establish whether the patient has noticed any changes in the skin's coloration or texture. 00:04:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:02Red flags associated with the integumentary system. 00:05:05So if you notice integumentary systems that seem worrisome, right? 00:05:13Such as presence of new sores, rashes, or lumps, for example, and those are accompanied by fever or ill appearance, extreme age, young or old, purpura or petechia, generalized or musculoskeletal pain. , extreme age, young or old, purpura or petechia, generalized or musculoskeletal pain. 00:05:30Immunocompromised patients, lymphadenopathy commonly offending drugs or non healing chronic lesions, chronic irregular and evolving lesions greater than six millimetres or oral lesions. 00:05:41You should communicate that along with the pertinent history, vitals and pertinent physical findings with the referring physician. 00:05:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:57Please review box 9.1 in your textbook, the psychological system. 00:06:01So there's an incredibly extensive list of disorders. 00:06:04Common symptoms of psychological disorders include fatigue, unexplained weight change, onset of confusion, difficulty concentrating and sleep disturbances. 00:06:13The range of mental disorders is so extensive that providing screening protocols for this entire category of illness is really beyond the scope of your textbook and beyond the scope of  so extensive that providing screening protocols for this entire category of illness is really beyond the scope of your textbook and beyond the scope of this class. 00:06:26Use the general health checklist along with other components from Box 9.1 to help screen. 00:06:30[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:32Fatigue, unexplained weight change, a change mentation or an onset of confusion or difficulty concentrating and sleep disturbance are symptoms associated with many psychological disorders. 00:06:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:51The musculoskeletal symptoms. 00:06:55Make sure and inquire about the onset of symptoms. 00:06:59Do the symptoms change over the course of the day? 00:07:01Do they vary by activity, posture, or other event? 00:07:05Are the symptoms worse at night? 00:07:08Is there a correlation between your physical examination and the patient's 05Are the symptoms worse at night? 00:07:08Is there a correlation between your physical examination and the patient's symptoms or the patient's complaint suggested a systemic disease such as weight loss, fever, chills, fatigue, confusion. 00:07:21Determining whether a symptoms story from the patient makes sense according to our understanding of basic and clinical sciences. 00:07:27Along with existing risk factors for cancers, infection, fractures, and inflammatory disorders is the basis for deciding whether to communicate with the physician. 00:07:38At this gross overview level, information that raises suspicion of a serious underlying disorder should lead you to further more focused investigation. 00:07:47[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:57Refer to box 9.13 in your textbook, checklist used by symptom, location or pain pattern. 00:08:03Not all checklists are required for every patient. 00:08:06Recognizing a typical patterns :08:03Not all checklists are required for every patient. 00:08:06Recognizing a typical patterns of symptoms is important when a patient presents with pain that is not predictable. 00:08:12[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:16Certain body systems may not present with a predictable pain location, but rather present with an atypical pattern of symptoms that move from one body region to another. 00:08:26Symptoms may be inconsistent in their intensity, increasing and decreasing regardless of time of day, posture and physical activity. 00:08:33[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:37The review of systems checklist. 00:08:40The use is based on medical history, the medical history will guide the checklist selection. 00:08:45A patient with a history of cardiovascular disease may be screened with items from the cardiovascular checklist to gather useful information pertinent to this patient. 00:08:54This may  may be screened with items from the cardiovascular checklist to gather useful information pertinent to this patient. 00:08:54This may also provide a baseline which you may use to monitor progression of the disease. 00:09:00For example, if the patient reports heart problems, one of the follow up questions to ask is what symptoms do you have with your heart problem? 00:09:08Knowing that the patient has a history of cardiovascular disease, should guide you to ask additional questions from the cardiovascular checklist. 00:09:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:20It's important to pull out the checklist and use it at follow-up visits. 00:09:24Not the entire thing and not every visit. 00:09:27Just use certain portions to assess changes in the patient's status. 00:09:31New complaints may warrant using different portions of the checklist. 00:09:35It's not necessary to repeat the entire review of systems  may warrant using different portions of the checklist. 00:09:35It's not necessary to repeat the entire review of systems at every single visit, but at times, asking questions again at a follow-up visit is certainly appropriate. 00:09:45[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:09:51So to summarize, I know this is an extensive amount of information. 00:09:56But you should recognize underlying disorders which may require a referral. 00:10:00The disorder you recognize and refer out may be different than the patient's chief complaint. 00:10:06You should try and minimize false alarms, but if you make a mistake, make it on the side of safety. 00:10:13Make sure and remember follow-up questions about symptoms. 00:10:17Is the patient's physician aware of the concerning symptoms? 00:10:20Is the patient providing an accurate history? 00:10:23Asking specific follow up  symptoms? 00:10:20Is the patient providing an accurate history? 00:10:23Asking specific follow up questions about the patient's symptoms, learning whether the patient's physician is aware of the symptoms, and if the symptoms have worsened. 00:10:32And finally, judging the patient's ability to give an accurate history does this complaint represents something new, different or unusual? 00:10:40All contribute the ability to distinguish a red flag. 00:10:43[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:52In closing, musculoskeletal problems are common. 00:10:54It is easy to become centered on the area where the pain is focused. 00:10:58However, there may be underlying urgent problems requiring immediate recognition and treatment. 00:11:04Appropriate use of the review of systems may alert you to underlying serious pathology. 00:11:10Patients who have musculoskeletal problems . 00:01:54Detecting these symptoms would prompt contact with the appropriate healthcare provider. 00:01:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:04So the review of systems is something we don't want to confuse with a systems review. 00:02:09The systems review is a hands on procedure. 00:02:13The review of systems does not require hands on. 00:02:15The goal is a brief examination of cardiopulmonary status, musculoskeletal, integumentary, and neuromuscular systems. 00:02:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:29So, review of systems, and here I refer you to Box 9.1, the initial review of systems screening in your Boissonnault. 00:02:38The review of systems can be included in a health history questionnaire provided to patients when they enter your clinic. 00:02:44If a yes is  of systems may alert you to underlying serious pathology. 00:11:10Patients who have musculoskeletal problems usually present with pain, deformity or weakness. 00:11:16Joint pain in general is the most common problem, and backache specifically is the most common disorder for which patients seek health care. 00:11:23The examination is often centered on the joints where the pain is focused. 00:11:27But frequently, muscles and nerves are also a focal point of the examination. 00:11:33Conditions associated with joint pain can be categorized into four major groups, mechanical problems, soft tissue conditions, inflammatory diseases and non-inflammatory diseases. 00:11:43Conditions frequently associated with joint pain include osteoarthritis, tendonitis, infection, gout, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus. 00:11:53A number of presentations are indications of urgent problems requiring immediate recognition and definitive treatment. 00: us. 00:11:53A number of presentations are indications of urgent problems requiring immediate recognition and definitive treatment. 00:12:00[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com  be included in a health history questionnaire provided to patients when they enter your clinic. 00:02:44If a yes is marked by a patient, does that mean it's truly a red flag? 00:02:49So a significant challenge for the physical therapist is deciding whether a positive response. 00:02:55A yes response truly constitutes a red flag, which would require communication with another health care provider. 00:03:02Or whether it's appropriate to simply note the presence of the finding and then to monitor it over time. 00:03:08[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:03:15This is an initial review of system screening and you should be familiar with this. 00:03:19It's in your textbook in Box 9.1. 00:03:22It's basically a collection of questions and the questions are trying to be as sensitive as possible to pick up any underlying serious medical issues. 00:03:32[BLANK_  trying to be as sensitive as possible to pick up any underlying serious medical issues. 00:03:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:40If there are yes responses on the patient questionnaire, then it's important to determine if that complaint is new, different, or maybe unusual for the patient. 00:03:50Is there an explanation for the change that would decrease your concern? 00:03:54Has the patient spoken about this complaint with their physician? 00:03:58If they have, has the problem become worse since they spoke with their physician? 00:04:04So if this is something new or something that's not easily explainable or it's worsened since the patient informed their physician. 00:04:11It might be worthwhile to reach out and inform the patient's physician of this change. 00:04:16Sometimes determining whether a yes represents a red flag can be very difficult. 00:04:21For example, fatigue. 16Sometimes determining whether a yes represents a red flag can be very difficult. 00:04:21For example, fatigue. 00:04:22What makes fatigue a red flag when even healthy people are sometimes tired? 00:04:27Red flag parameters may help a little, and we'll go over those. 00:04:31[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:38So when is it important that we communicate those yes responses, that information, with the patient's physician? 00:04:45When it's something new. 00:04:47When it's something that's not easily explainable, or when it's something that's worsened since the patient first informed their physician, as we reviewed on the last slide. 00:04:55So if this is something new or not easily explainable, or it's worsened since the patient informed their physician. 00:05:00It could be worthwhile to communicate this information with that patient's physician.  the patient informed their physician. 00:05:00It could be worthwhile to communicate this information with that patient's physician. 00:05:04[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video?

[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:15The integumentary systems checklist, please refer to box 9.12 in your textbook. 00:02:23Patient history questions may include information about skin, hair, nails, any new or unexplained or unusual changes in those areas. 00:02:34Try and diagram wounds, abrasions, and bruises as you ask the patient about their symptoms. 00:02:39During the physical examination, follow up using the body the body diagram. 00:02:45Even though many skin disorders are self limiting, almost any skin condition can be extremely distressing for an individual. 00:02:52Not only is a large portion of the skin clearly visible so that all can see any abnormality, but the skin is also an extremely sensitive organ and its disorders invoke a wide range of symptoms. 00:03:04However, in addition to minor self-limiting conditions, the skin serves as a barometer for overall 9.2 General Health Screening and Red Flags00:00:00So, this is presentation 9.2, General Health Screening and Red Flags. 00:00:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:11Our objectives for this presentation are to be able to define the General Health screening tool. 00:00:17Describe strategies for following up on fatigue related General Health screening questions which are marked yes. 00:00:24Identify red flag findings, those that warrant physician contact, and those associated with fatigue. 00:00:30And finally, we should be able to describe strategies for following up on malaise-related General Health screening questions which are marked yes. 00:00:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:44General Health screening, first I'd refer you to your textbook and box 9.2. 00:00:50And the General Health screening can be useful for a first line of medical screening  box 9.2. 00:00:50And the General Health screening can be useful for a first line of medical screening. 00:00:56We can perform a broad screen of organ systems and systemic disorders. 00:01:00If all responses are marked no, a PT then can be relatively comfortable treating the patient. 00:01:07If a pain pattern is also unremarkable, the PT can also be pretty comfortable treating that patient. 00:01:14The first seven items found in box 9.1 along the left column, along with malaise and mentation changes, are complaints that can result from diseases of a number of different body systems. 00:01:26Multi-system disorders, systemic illnesses, and adverse drug reactions. 00:01:31Some of these symptoms, for example fatigue and malaise, are extremely vague but may be the initial manifestations of a very serious underlying illness. 00:01:40[BLANK_AUDIO  vague but may be the initial manifestations of a very serious underlying illness. 00:01:40[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:47So just as we reviewed in the last lecture, if there are yes responses, it's then up to you to determine if that complaint is new, different, or unusual for the patient. 00:01:58Is there an explanation for the change that would decrease your concern? 00:02:01Has the patient spoken about this with their physician? 00:02:04And if the physician has been spoken with, has the problem become worse since the time the physician became aware of it? 00:02:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:18So additional required information about fatigue. 00:02:21Some of the questions you might ask the patient could include when did your fatigue begin? 00:02:27Was it gradual onset? 00:02:29Have you noticed other unusual symptoms like nausea  begin? 00:02:27Was it gradual onset? 00:02:29Have you noticed other unusual symptoms like nausea, fever, or loss of weight, bilateral joint pain, or early morning stiffness? 00:02:38The presence of the above symptoms could suggest malignancy, infection, or even rheumatic disorder. 00:02:44Fatigue can be associated with many serious illnesses, including some psychological disorders, infections, cancers, medication use, and endocrine disorders. 00:02:55Fatigue can be challenging to differentiate when we're trying to discern between fatigue associated with normal life versus fatigue associated with some kind of serious underlying disorder. 00:03:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:12So here we'll explore some red flags associated with fatigue, and you can look at your textbook, box 9.3. 00:03:19But fatigue that interferes with the patient's ability to carry out normal activities or fatigue 3. 00:03:19But fatigue that interferes with the patient's ability to carry out normal activities or fatigue that lasts for more than four weeks without a clear explanation can be worrisome. 00:03:31When you're communicating with another provider, it's important to describe the specifics of the condition, including changes in your patient's functional capacity. 00:03:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:41So an example may be that a patient says that up until three weeks ago, she typically worked eight to nine hours every day and then went home and helped take care of dinner and then was active until she went to bed at 11 PM. 00:03:53Now that same patient struggles to make it through her workday. 00:03:57She went home early from work twice this week because of her fatigue. 00:04:00And when she comes home from work, she barely makes it through dinner and has been going to bed  00:04:00And when she comes home from work, she barely makes it through dinner and has been going to bed by 9 PM. 00:04:05On the other hand, reports of pregnancy, new medication that is associated with fatigue, or recovery from illness may explain some of these symptoms and decrease the likelihood of red flags. 00:04:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:24So this slide addresses the term malaise, which you'll find in your textbook. 00:04:28And some of the questions to ask regarding malaise include when did your fatigue begin and was it gradual? 00:04:35Have you noticed other unusual symptoms such as nausea, fever, loss of weight, bilateral joint pain, or early morning stiffness? 00:04:43The presence of the above symptoms may suggest malignancy, infection, or rheumatic disorder. 00:04:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00: ignancy, infection, or rheumatic disorder. 00:04:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:50So as an aside, when reviewing the literature, there are very limited results regarding the term malaise in PubMed and UpToDate and in other differential diagnosis textbooks that I tried to look through. 00:05:03Fatigue instead is a more common non-specific symptom. 00:05:06And that being said, for your text, malaise is a sense of uneasiness or general discomfort, and quote, out of sorts, unquote feeling. 00:05:15And your text notes that patients may describe this uneasiness as an intuition that something isn't right or that they're coming down with something. 00:05:23This is different from post-exertional malaise which is an increase in severity of fatigue, weakness, dizziness, heart rate variation, temperature dysregulation following physical or cognitive  which is an increase in severity of fatigue, weakness, dizziness, heart rate variation, temperature dysregulation following physical or cognitive exertion. 00:05:36So again, I think it's important that you understand what malaise is. 00:05:40But I think it's just as important that you understand that it's much more likely that you'll see the term fatigue used. 00:05:46[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com 9.3 Weight Loss and Nausea00:00:00So lecture three, Review of Symptoms, Weight Loss, and Nausea. 00:00:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:09So the objectives for this lecture, by the end you should be able to describe strategies for following up on fever, chills, and sweats related to general health screening questions. 00:00:19You should be able to identify red flag findings associated with fever, chills, and sweats. 00:00:24You should be able to describe strategies for following up on unexplained weight change from the general health screening questions. 00:00:32You should be able to identify red flag findings associated with involuntary weight loss. 00:00:37And describe strategies for following up on nausea and vomiting, and the general health screening questions which are marked yes. 00:00:43Finally, you should be able to identify red flag findings associated with nausea and vomiting  are marked yes. 00:00:43Finally, you should be able to identify red flag findings associated with nausea and vomiting. 00:00:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:58Fever, Chills, and Sweats. 00:01:01These are generally representative of systemic illnesses such as infections, cancers, and rheumatoid arthritis. 00:01:07If fever is checked as yes on a questionnaire, then you should follow up with additional questions, such as are you currently suffering from the flu? 00:01:16Could you have a sinus or other kind of infection? 00:01:19You should also take the patient's temperature. 00:01:22It's possible that a patient does have an infection but that patient may not have a fever. 00:01:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:30In older patients especially, infections can occur in the absence of fever. 00: :07:37Vomit that is bile-colored may be related to intestinal obstruction. 00:07:41Vomit that appears like coffee-grounds could contain blood. 00:07:44Make sure again to communicate the onset, the frequency, vitals, presence and nature of the vomit, and any changes in medication. 00:07:54And have the patient rate the severity of their nausea on a scale through 0 to 10 when you communicate the findings to the physician. 00:08:00[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com _AUDIO] 00:01:30In older patients especially, infections can occur in the absence of fever. 00:01:34Therefore, accompany conditions that may generate a fever include fatigue and myalgias, change in mental status, chills, sweats, tachycardia, confusion, and delirium. 00:01:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:54Red flags for fever include at least 99.5 to 101 degrees Fahrenheit for 3 weeks without discovery of a cause. 00:02:04A patient who's traveled recently, or had a recent illness or recent infection. 00:02:09Are there new skin lesions, new redness or edema? 00:02:13This could be indicative of some kind of inflammatory process. 00:02:16You should assess the heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate. 00:02:20Any abdominal tenderness may indicate appendicitis, cholecystitis , and respiratory rate. 00:02:20Any abdominal tenderness may indicate appendicitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or hepatitis. 00:02:28You should communicate the temperature, the duration of the elevated temperature or fever, and any other pertinent findings with the provider. 00:02:35[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:37So three weeks of a fever should account for any self-limiting viruses. 00:02:42102 degrees or higher indicates a more urgent likelihood of referral of communication with the physician. 00:02:48The physical examination should include examining the skin for lesions, again looking for redness and increased temperature or edema, which might be indicative of some kind of infection or inflammatory process. 00:03:01Consider the patient's medical history, including lymphoma, leukemia, HIV. 00:03:06A cardiac history which might include pericarditis, endocarditis, or upper respiratory  HIV. 00:03:06A cardiac history which might include pericarditis, endocarditis, or upper respiratory illness. 00:03:13Also, nail beds could exhibit cyanosis. 00:03:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:23So, Unexplained Weight Change. 00:03:25Involuntary weight loss is more common than weight gain. 00:03:30It's a very sensitive but not a specific finding. 00:03:33So, some questions you might ask include, how much weight have you lost or gained, and over how long of a period? 00:03:39Do you know why you've lost or gained weight? 00:03:42Have you noticed any other new symptoms? 00:03:45If the patient has purposely changed his or her diet or increased physical activity during the time of the weight loss, then your concern can drop considerably. 00:03:53Now  or increased physical activity during the time of the weight loss, then your concern can drop considerably. 00:03:53Now there's a reason or an explanation for the weight loss. 00:03:56Rapid weight gain is often associated with fluid retention, such as edema or ascites. 00:04:03And this can be a manifestation of conditions such as congestive heart failure, liver or renal disease, and preeclampsia. 00:04:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:18Red flags associated with involuntary weight loss. 00:04:23A 5 to 10% unexplained loss of body weight over 6 to 12 months can be considered a red flag. 00:04:31Malignancy, diabetes, digestive disease, thyroid disease, depression may all be associated with involuntary weight loss. 00:04:39Is the patient presenting with a cough or shortness of breath? 00:04:43It's important to take a 39Is the patient presenting with a cough or shortness of breath? 00:04:43It's important to take a medical history, especially in older patients, due to polypharmacy. 00:04:48Psychosocial factors should also be considered, including finances, or transport, limiting the ability to purchase groceries, an inability to prepare meals. 00:04:59You should communicate changes of weight, the time period over which those changes occurred, and any other pertinent findings to the patient's physician. 00:05:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:10A gain of five pounds or more over a one-week period during pregnancy could be a warning sign potentially associated with preeclampsia, and you should be sure to note this. 00:05:20An unexplained weight loss, as we noted above, is considered significant if it's greater than 5% of the usual body weight of the patient over a 6 to 12 month period.  considered significant if it's greater than 5% of the usual body weight of the patient over a 6 to 12 month period. 00:05:29And it's often indicative of a serious medical or psychological illness. 00:05:33A slow weight decrease in the elderly is not uncommon and could be due to a lack of appetite, institutional food, disinterest in food resulting from a decreased sense of taste or smell. 00:05:45A thorough medication history is critical, especially in elderly patients or those with chronic diseases who are on a multitude of medications. 00:05:53A psychosocial history is also crucial, especially in the elderly population, who may not be eating due to the inability to shop for groceries because of financial or transportation problems. 00:06:03An inability to prepare meals resulting from a functional limitation, or poorly fitting dentures or no dentures or a loss of appetite owing to depression or medications. 00:06:13[BLANK_AUD  or no dentures or a loss of appetite owing to depression or medications. 00:06:13[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:20Nausea and Vomiting. 00:06:21Please look at box 9.4 in your textbook. 00:06:25Nausea is common in normal life, and additional questions are often necessary to tease out what the cause might be. 00:06:32Triggering events could include meals, motion, pain, etc. 00:06:36Some questions to ask your patients include, describe your nausea, is it constant? 00:06:41How frequent is it? 00:06:42Are there any new or unusual symptoms? 00:06:45Do you know why you feel nauseous? 00:06:47Have you been vomiting? 00:06:49Have you been vomiting without nausea? 00:06:51How have you been treating your nausea? 00:06: 49Have you been vomiting without nausea? 00:06:51How have you been treating your nausea? 00:06:54Nausea and vomiting usually stem from GI infections but may reflect many categories or problems, including other infections. 00:07:03Actual or functional GI obstruction, metabolic disorders, central nervous system disorders, drugs, pain, pregnancy, and psychiatric disorders. 00:07:13Always check to see if the patient has made their physician aware of the issue. 00:07:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:22Red flags associated with nausea and vomiting. 00:07:26So nausea or vomiting associated with any change in medication, including running out of running out of medication, is a red flag. 00:07:33Vomit that is green-yellow may represent biliary colic. 00:07:37Vomit that is bile-colored may be related to intestinal obstruction. 00:07:41 9.4 Strategies in Response to the General Health Screening00:00:01Lecture 9 for strategies in response to the general health screening 00:00:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:09.Objectives, by the end of this lecture you should be able to describe strategies for following up on paresthesia numbness, or weakness-related general health screening questions. 00:00:23You should be able to identify red flag findings, those that weren't physician contact associated with paresthesia, numbness or weakness. 00:00:32You should describe strategies for following up on dizziness and lightheadedness, you should be able to identify red flag findings that weren't physician contact associated with dizziness and lightheadedness. 00:00:44You should be able to describe strategies for following up on changes in mental status. 00:00:48And finally, you should be able to identify red flag findings that warrant  on changes in mental status. 00:00:48And finally, you should be able to identify red flag findings that warrant physician contact associated with change in mental status. 00:00:55[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:02Paresthesia, numbness, or weakness. 00:01:05Other conditions besides neurological disorders can present as paresthesia, numbness or weakness, so you might ask a patient have you experienced any changes in sensation or strength? 00:01:17If they have are those changes associated with specific activities, what's the distribution of the numbness or weakness, are there any associated balance deficits? 00:01:27Any changes in vision, taste, smell, or hearing. 00:01:30Many patients report weakness, but much like fatigue, this finding is often not a red flag. 00:01:37If a patient tells you my back feels weak or my knee gives out, these are examples of  changes in the elderly, are notable if they're associated with an infection, or a urinary tract infection, acute changes may also be associated with head trauma. 00:08:20Progressive changes that may be associated with changes in gait, or incontinence, gradual, but meaningful changes in mental status are also of note, communicate to the physician. 00:08:30Altered mentation and confusion are such general terms, the onus is on the PT to be as specific as possible in collecting these data and communicate these concerns to a physician 00:08:40[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:45You should use of valid and reliable tests and measures, will make communication with the physician much more effective. 00:08:56[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com  | cielo24.com . 00:01:37If a patient tells you my back feels weak or my knee gives out, these are examples of comments that would require additional questioning to figure out whether there is a serious neurological issue. 00:01:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:50History should include the type of weakness whether it's proximal weakness which might alert you to thyroid disease or malignancy or maybe even adrenal dysfunction, or distal weakness. 00:02:00Which would raise an index of sufficient for neurological cause, especially if it was accompanied by paresthesia. 00:02:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:13Red flags associated with paresthesia, numbness, or weakness, progressive sensory or strength deficits, so changes in sensation or strength over time. 00:02:25Saddle anesthesia change in bowel or bladder function, glove and stocking distribution of sensation loss, combination upper and lower extremity alteration of addle anesthesia change in bowel or bladder function, glove and stocking distribution of sensation loss, combination upper and lower extremity alteration of sensory and/or motor performance. 00:02:39Again, you should communicate to the physician the onset of the symptoms, the frequency, the presence and nature of altered sensation or motor function. 00:02:47And any other pertinent physical examination findings. 00:02:51Chronic renal failure, multiple sclerosis, hypothyroidism, and adverse drug events are examples of disorders that could present with these findings. 00:02:59Any subjective complaints of numbness or tingling require further investigation. 00:03:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:09Dizziness and lightheadedness, please see box 9.5 in your textbook, your patient may present a complaint of feeling light-headed or faint. 00:03:25These sensations may be associated with various systems or even adverse drug reactions, you might headed or faint. 00:03:25These sensations may be associated with various systems or even adverse drug reactions, you might ask your patient if they're feeling light-headed or if they notice spinning sensation. 00:03:35And if they do, is that sensation associated with any certain position or movement? 00:03:40You could ask your patient if they've fallen because of these symptoms. 00:03:44Are the symptoms associated with nausea, vomiting, changes in hearing or vision, hemiparesis or even vital signs? 00:03:51Patients interpret dizziness differently, therefore, it's important to differentiate vertigo, which is a spinning sensation, vestibular disturbance, middle ear disturbance. 00:03:59Or even a cerebellar disturbance, dysfunction, and differentiate that from lightheadedness, which is generally associated with dehydration, hypotension, hypo or hyperglycemia. 00:04:11Heart block infection, cardiovascular or  with dehydration, hypotension, hypo or hyperglycemia. 00:04:11Heart block infection, cardiovascular or cerebellar confusion. 00:04:17For certain types of disorders causing dizziness, PT management should be the primary treatment, whereas other causes will require a physician management. 00:04:26You should examine vital signs, heart and lung sounds, and incorporate special tests related to dizziness. 00:04:32Such as the Dix-Hallpike maneuver and Romberg tests, because these can help aid diagnosis. 00:04:38Differentiate from vestibular disorders and Meniere's disease, vertebrobasilar insufficiency may be associated with visual disturbance for hemiparesis along with dizziness. 00:04:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:54Dizziness and lightheadedness, so a patient may describe near fainting or fainting, they may present with slurred speech  lightheadedness, so a patient may describe near fainting or fainting, they may present with slurred speech, numbness of their face or limbs, visual changes, particularly diplopia. 00:05:08It can be an acute onset associated with nausea or vomiting. 00:05:12[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:13You should communicate findings again related to the onset, the frequency, the neurological, and the physical exam findings. 00:05:22Dizziness can be a precursor to seizures, closer investigation is warranted if dizziness has become more frequent or if the dizziness has been lasting for longer, as this may be a pre-cursor in stroke. 00:05:34A history of head or ear trauma should be determined, along with a history of infections and a review of medications. 00:05:41Or recreational history including things like scuba or skydiving, high altitude hiking air travel, or  00:05:41Or recreational history including things like scuba or skydiving, high altitude hiking air travel, or even dehydration from exercise to be investigated. 00:05:51Alcohol and substance abuse as well as anxiety or panic attacks should also be investigated. 00:05:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:04Changes in mental status a patient may present with confusion, or disorientation, and that can be related to many different disorders. 00:06:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:12Has the patient or the patient's family noticed these difficulties? 00:06:15You might ask, when did you first note the change, do you know the cause, was the onset slow or gradual, have you noticed any other new problems associated with this onset? 00:06:26The onset of confusion or disorientation or worsening of the symptoms can be a manifestation of multiple different disorders. 00:06:  onset of confusion or disorientation or worsening of the symptoms can be a manifestation of multiple different disorders. 00:06:34The cause of mental status changes include, but are not limited to Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia, stroke, central nervous system infections. 00:06:44Neurodegenerative disorders, head Injury lesions metabolic disorders and hydrocephalus among others. 00:06:51[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:57Changing mental status observations. 00:07:00Do you notice a change in your level of consciousness, changing your patients attention or ability to focus changes in a patient's memory, their long or their short-term. 00:07:10Changes in the patient's orientation in terms of their ability to recognize person, place and time, change in their ability to process thoughts logically, or any changes in your patients judgments. 00:07:21[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:26  or any changes in your patients judgments. 00:07:21[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:26If you suspect confusion or disorientation during the history, make observations including those that I just mentioned, and it may be important to share those observations not only with the patient. 00:07:36But with the caregiver or family, and ask if the caregiver or family has noticed these difficulties. 00:07:42The neurological examination should focus on assessment of cognition and assessment of mental status by using the mental state examination or another validated screening instrument. 00:07:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:59Changes in mental status, acute changes could be associated with fever, a stiff neck, or a headache. 00:08:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:10Acute changes in the elderly, are notable if they're associated with an infection, or a urinary tract infection, acute changes may also 9.5 Upper Body SymptomsEffects00:00:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:02Lecture 9.5, we're going to begin to talk about upper body symptoms. 00:00:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:11By the end of the lecture, you should be able to describe strategies for following up on dyspnea, palpitations, syncope, cardiovascular related pain. 00:00:21And you should be able to identify red flag findings associated with chest pain or chest pressure. 00:00:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:33The general health checklist I'd like you to look at box 9.1 and 9.6 as well as table 9.2 in your textbook. 00:00:41And then note the overlap between cardiovascular, peripheral vascular and pulmonary systems. 00:00:47Some items listed in box 9.1, including dyspnea , peripheral vascular and pulmonary systems. 00:00:47Some items listed in box 9.1, including dyspnea, cough and palpitations, overlap with the checklist for the cardiovascular peripheral vascular and pulmonary systems. 00:00:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:08Dyspnea is the subjective sensation of difficulty breathing. 00:01:12This could be related to activity, exertion or body position. 00:01:17You might ask your patient when did the shortness of breath begin? 00:01:19Was the onset sudden or did it occur over time? 00:01:23Did you wake suddenly at night with shortness of breath? 00:01:25Is the shortness of breath constant? 00:01:28Does your shortness of breath occur with exertion? 00:01:31Does it occur at rest, or does it occur in certain positions? 00:01:35Dysp ally mediated causes of syncope. 00:08:09There are causes of syncope that are related to orthostatic hypotension and there are cardiovascular causes of syncope. 00:08:18[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:23Determining whether pain is associated with cardiovascular pathology. 00:08:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:30So chest pain or tightness extending into the left upper extremity is typically associated with cardiovascular pathology. 00:08:37Jaw, neck, tooth, right shoulder, epigastric and midthoracic pain be refered from cardiovascular pathology. 00:08:46Pain in this locations accompanied by excessive sweating, especially in a patient with additional risk factor for cardiac disease should raise suspicion of cardiovascular origin. 00:08:58Pain from coronary related ischemia is more often characterized as non focal chest discomfort or pressure than pain. 00:09:07The onset is  ischemia is more often characterized as non focal chest discomfort or pressure than pain. 00:09:07The onset is generally gradual and is exacerbated by activity. 00:09:12Discomfort that radiates particularly to either or both arms should increase suspicion for cardiovascular disease. 00:09:20A personal or family history of cardiovascular disease, older age, diabetes, dyslipidemia, cigarette smoking, hypertension, or drug use all increase the likelihood. 00:09:33Females are more likely to have associated dyspnea than males and patients who are older or have diabetes. 00:09:40I'm more likely to present with dyspnea without chest pain. 00:09:43[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:50Certain medications may cause the patient to sweat excessively. 00:09:53This chart is an example of some of those medications which include antidepressants, cholinergic agents, hormonal agents, hypoglycemics sympath  an example of some of those medications which include antidepressants, cholinergic agents, hormonal agents, hypoglycemics sympathomimetic agents and other agents including beta blockers. 00:10:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:15Red flags for chest pain and pressure include a sudden onset of chest pain and pressure, a severe crushing, chest pain and pressure is described by the patient. 00:10:25Chest pain lasting more than 15 minutes. 00:10:28Pain that worsens with exertion and physical activity. 00:10:31Chest pain which is accompanied by shortness of breath, nausea, excessive sweating, or vomiting. 00:10:39Chest pain accompanied by left arm, neck or radiating jaw pain also, changes in vital signs, such as tachycardia, bradycardia, or hypotension. 00:10:49When communicating with the physician, include vitals, symptoms, duration, intensity. 00  hypotension. 00:10:49When communicating with the physician, include vitals, symptoms, duration, intensity. 00:10:55Is this the initial episode? 00:10:57Is the pain constant or is it intermittent? 00:11:01The coronary arteries supply blood to the heart muscle and narrowing in one of the coronary arteries results in decreased blood supply. 00:11:10And when the lesion becomes significant, myocardial ischemia and chest pain occur. 00:11:15Any complaint of chest pain or other symptoms suggestive of ischemia should be thoroughly investigated. 00:11:22Initially, determine whether the patient is having active cardiac symptoms during the evaluation, which would require emergent transport to the closest emergency department using EMS. 00:11:34Symptoms associated with the highest relative risk of myocardial infarction include radiation to an upper extremity, particularly when there is radiation to both arms. 00:11:43  infarction include radiation to an upper extremity, particularly when there is radiation to both arms. 00:11:43And pain associated with diaphoresis or with nausea and vomiting. 00:11:48An important question is whether current pain is reminiscent of prior myocardial infarction. 00:11:54Of note no one pain characteristic has sufficient positive or negative, predictive value to definitively diagnose versus fluid acute cardiac symptoms. 00:12:06[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com 01:31Does it occur at rest, or does it occur in certain positions? 00:01:35Dyspnea, or shortness of breath, has many causes including cardiac or pulmonary disease, as well as anxiety, obesity, and anemia. 00:01:45Patients with a cardiac cause may also complain of increased symptoms with exertion and symptoms or dyspnea that wake them up at night and are relieved by sitting up. 00:01:54[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:58PND, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, is one of the early signs of heart failure and therefore is more specific for cardiac disease. 00:02:08Dyspnea caused by cardiac disease results most commonly from left ventricular dysfunction and or valvular disease. 00:02:16Typically, difficulty with breathing would be associated with activity or exertion. 00:02:21So if you ask about dysp , difficulty with breathing would be associated with activity or exertion. 00:02:21So if you ask about dyspnea only in this context, patients may not volunteer that they get short of breath when they lie down. 00:02:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:36Palpitations are an awareness of forceful rapid or irregular beating of the heart. 00:02:41Occasional palpitations occur in most of the population. 00:02:44Palpitations may be described as uncomfortable sensations in the chest and they may be associated with arrhythmias. 00:02:51Your patient may describe palpitations as fluttering, jumping, pounding, irregularity, or feeling like their heart is skipping a beat. 00:03:01You should ask your patient about their frequency, the duration, and any associated symptoms. 00:03:06You should also ask your patient about any history of heart disease, myocard  and any associated symptoms. 00:03:06You should also ask your patient about any history of heart disease, myocardial infarction, heart attack, or valvular heart disease. 00:03:15Occasional palpitations occur physiologically and the majority of the population. 00:03:21Or in some people as a result of other non cardiac conditions such as anxiety, panic attacks, somatization, exercise, hyperthyroidism and anemia. 00:03:30Palpitations can also occur with valvular heart disease, increased or decreased stroke volume, and during arrhythmias. 00:03:40Ask your patient about the frequency and duration of the palpitations, as well as the presence of any associated symptoms, such as a loss of consciousness, lightheadedness, chest pain, or pressure. 00:03:52Or shortness of breath, nausea, or vomiting. 00:03:56Occasionally, . 00:03:52Or shortness of breath, nausea, or vomiting. 00:03:56Occasionally, young healthy patients may have frequent PVCs that are benign in nature but warrant investigation to rule out serious causes. 00:04:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:14Syncope, or transient loss of consciousness, TLOC. 00:04:19Syncope is a sudden loss of consciousness accompanied by an inability to maintain postural tone, followed by spontaneous recovery, which patients often describe as fainting. 00:04:30This increases with age, especially in individuals over 70. 00:04:34Physical therapists should assess the number and frequency of falls, the duration of syncope, the span of time between episodes, patient's caloric intake, fluid intake, hydration status. 00:04:46Any evidence of substance abuse and the patient's vital signs. 00:04:51A patient with multiple episodes occurring over a Any evidence of substance abuse and the patient's vital signs. 00:04:51A patient with multiple episodes occurring over a short period of time. 00:04:56In other words several days or weeks, is more likely to be suffering from a serious underlying disorder such as intermittent highgrade, atrioventricular, block peroxisomal, ventricular tachycardia etc. 00:05:10And these patients require aggressive evaluation. 00:05:13However, it is unusual for multiple syncope episodes to occur in a single day. 00:05:18Many episodes of apparent syncope each day, or episodes lasting many minutes in duration, may indicate that the patient is suffering from non syncope psychogenic disorders. 00:05:30Are what's called psychogenic pseudosyncope, or psychogenic pseudoseizures. 00:05:37In general, the longer the period of time over which episodes have occurred, for example, many years  00:05:37In general, the longer the period of time over which episodes have occurred, for example, many years versus a recent onset. 00:05:44And the younger the patient's age at onset, particularly when the patient is less than 35 the less likely it is that the cause of syncope is life threatening unless the individual has identifiable structural heart disease. 00:05:56[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:02Syncope, prognosis and level of seriousness, the term syncope is often misapplied to seizures or other issues which are not accompanied by a transient loss of consciousness. 00:06:15Syncope is self terminating and it's the result of inadequate nutrient flow to the brain. 00:06:22Establishing the likely cause of this can help establish prognosis. 00:06:26Syncope during exercise or during exertion is serious. 00:06:30Syncope following exercise or after exertion is Syncope during exercise or during exertion is serious. 00:06:30Syncope following exercise or after exertion is less serious. 00:06:37Neurocardiogenic syncope, also called vasovagal syncope, is a common cause of dizziness and fainting. 00:06:43And it is the result of a sudden decrease in blood pressure and heart rate after prolonged standing or through stress or by dehydration. 00:06:53It is a result of sympathetic sensitivity causing a reflexive response that suddenly causes bradycardia and venous dilation. 00:07:01The result is hypotension and dizziness. 00:07:05The timing of syncope in relation to exercise is very important, as syncope during a full flight exercise may be indicative of a serious condition. 00:07:15While syncope immediately after exercise tends to be more innocent and reflects an origin. 00:07:22Syncope that occurs While syncope immediately after exercise tends to be more innocent and reflects an origin. 00:07:22Syncope that occurs during exertion suggests a potentially life threatening etiology. 00:07:27And this should be taken very seriously. 00:07:30On the other hand, syncope that occurs soon after the termination of exertion, for example during the cooling off, is more likely reflex in origin, similar to a vasovagal fainting. 00:07:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:49So, this chart is intended to help illustrate potential causes of syncope, and when you have time, please take a brief look through it. 00:07:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:03What I'd like you to take away from the chart is that there are neurally mediated causes of syncope. 00:08:09There are causes of syncope that are related to orthostatic 9.6 Cough and

checklist. 00:00:27Describe strategies for following up on respiratory sounds. 00:00:31Identify items included in the hematological systems checklist. 00:00:35And describe important hematological signs and symptoms to be aware of, especially if checklist items are worrisome. 00:00:40[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:46So the presence of a cough may trigger concerns regarding pulmonary system or cardiovascular system pathology. 00:00  00:00:46So the presence of a cough may trigger concerns regarding pulmonary system or cardiovascular system pathology. 00:00:54A cough at night could be associated with heart failure or calcium channel blockers. 00:00:59You should inquire whether there's history of cigarette smoking, allergies, or even post-nasal drip associated with the cough. 00:01:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:08So the presentation of a cough should trigger concern about the pulmonary system, but also with disorders of the cardiovascular system. 00:01:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:19The cough may be associated with very serious disorders such as asthma, pneumonia, cancer, or even heart failure. 00:01:26However, keep in mind that a cough is an extremely common and potentially nonspecific complaint. 00:01:33So how do we determine how serious the cough is clinically? 00:01:36[BLANK pitting edema suggests lymphatic obstruction or hypothyroidism. 00:07:43[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:54Moving on to the pulmonary system checklist, I'd like you to take a look at Box 9.6 in your textbook. 00:08:02Note that wheezing is a high pitched noise related to partial airway obstruction, while stridor is a high pitched noise associated with trachea or larynx obstruction. 00:08:11You should watch for additional signs of pulmonary distress. 00:08:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:17This pulmonary distress may be associated with asthma, bronchitis, COPD, or even malignancy. 00:08:24Note the quote at the bottom, all that wheezes is not asthma, and all that wheezes is obstruction. 00:08:30[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:38Regarding  that wheezes is obstruction. 00:08:30[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:38Regarding respiratory sounds, some questions you may follow up with include asking your patients if they've noticed this noise before. 00:08:48Ask them, do you know why the sound exists? 00:08:51How long has it been present? 00:08:53How often does it occur? 00:08:55Are there any factors that seem to cause or worsen it? 00:08:59According to UptoDate, there are at least 29 potential causes of wheezing in the upper airway, the central airway, and the lower airways. 00:09:08Wheezing is an audible respiratory sound often associated with the sense of chest tightness and/or dyspnea. 00:09:15Many of the conditions included in the preceding discussions of cough and dyspnea also cause wheezing and chest tight :15Many of the conditions included in the preceding discussions of cough and dyspnea also cause wheezing and chest tightness. 00:09:22For this reason, the history and physical assessment

hematologic system checklist is in Box 9.7 of your textbook. 00:09:46Blood disorders include erythrocyte, leukocyte, platelet conditions, and bleeding disorders. 00:09:52These can be associated with potentially severe underlying disease. 00:09:56The symptoms and signs here may alert the therapist to communicate with the patient's MD. 00:10:02Abnormal bleeding, in addition to cuts and scrapes that

as rehabilitation guidelines and potential symptoms associated with high and low values. 00:10:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:31Hematological disorders, signs and symptoms. 00:10:34So first, you should ascertain whether there's a history of a hematologic disorder. 00:10:40Is there easy bruising, fatigue, shortness of breath, fever, or frequent infections, presence of liver disease, and/or alcohol abuse? 00:10:49Risk factors for hepatitis, presents of leukemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathies may be associated with bruising  for hepatitis, presents of leukemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathies may be associated with bruising, fever, and petechiae. 00:10:58A rapid heart rate or murmur, nail cyanosis may be present, capillary refill may be altered. 00:11:05Hematologic disorders are likely to cause increased bleeding, and those disorders include thrombocytopenia, leukemia, aplastic anemia, and hereditary coagulopathies. 00:11:17Multiple hematologic disorders can be seen with liver disease, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, leukocytosis, and impaired synthesis of clotting factors. 00:11:27[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com  your video? | cielo24.com  00:01:33So how do we determine how serious the cough is clinically? 00:01:36[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:42Follow-up questions you might ask a patient who presents with a cough include, how long have you had the cough? 00:01:48What do you think the cause is? 00:01:50Is your cough constant? 00:01:52Is it related or does it change with your position or posture? 00:01:56Is it a productive cough? 00:01:57And so, what's the color of the sputum? 00:02:00Is your cough painful? 00:02:02You should also assess whether symptoms on the general health checklist are associated with the cough. 00:02:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:09A productive cough lasting three weeks or longer should raise concern. 00:02:15Sputum that is yellow :09A productive cough lasting three weeks or longer should raise concern. 00:02:15Sputum that is yellow, red, rust, or green is likely associated with pathology. 00:02:20A cough associated with heart failure may occur in a recumbent position. 00:02:25Chest auscultation may be appropriate for the physical therapist, if serious underlying pathology is suspected. 00:02:32The patient history should include a thorough analysis of the cough, including a determination of how long it has persisted. 00:02:40It's essential to identify any associated symptoms including shortness of breath, wheezing, orthopnea, fever, chills, chest pain or discomfort, sputum production, post-nasal drainage, and hemoptysis. 00:02:55The medical history should be comprehensive, with a particular focus on the potential for asthma, COPD, chronic or acute bronchitis, heart failure, GER , with a particular focus on the potential for asthma, COPD, chronic or acute bronchitis, heart failure, GERD, or recent upper or lower respiratory infections. 00:03:12The medication history will not only exclude the potential for ACE inhibitor induced cough, but will also identify other problems for which medications are taken. 00:03:21The patient's prior self-treatment or prescribed treatment of cough should be explored, including the response and tolerance of the treatment. 00:03:29The patient's family history should also be established. 00:03:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:37Potential danger signs associated with a cough include fever, night sweats, purulent sputum, dyspnea, and hemoptysis. 00:03:46You should also inquire whether your patient has spoken with their physician. 00:03:51Important danger signs that we will need further evaluation with the chest radiograph and possible laboratory testing  physician. 00:03:51Important danger signs that we will need further evaluation with the chest radiograph and possible laboratory testing and CT include the following. 00:04:00Fevers, night sweats, or weight loss raise suspicion for chronic infection such as tuberculosis, lung abscess, or rheumatic disease. 00:04:09Purulent sputum warrants evaluation for pulmonary and possibly sinus infection, followed by treatment of identified infections. 00:04:17Hemoptysis can be an indicator of infection, such as lung abscess or tuberculosis, cancer, for example, lung, bronchus, or larynx cancer, or rheumatic diseases, heart failure, or foreign body inhalation. 00:04:32Dyspnea can be a clue to airway obstruction or a lung parenchymal disease. 00:04:38Other features such as waxing and waning versus progressively worsening symptoms, particular triggers, associated hoarseness  00:04:38Other features such as waxing and waning versus progressively worsening symptoms, particular triggers, associated hoarseness, and focal abnormalities on examination can help focus the investigation. 00:04:50Pulmonary function testing, including pre and post-bronchodilator testing, is important to characterize the potential problem causing both dyspnea and cough. 00:05:02Immunosuppression can be a risk factor for infections such as tuberculosis, and it should prompt a diligent and rapid evaluation for infection. 00:05:10[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:17Peripheral edema is when fluid collects in the lower extremities in ambulatory patients. 00:05:23In non-ambulatory patients, it tends to collect in the sacral area. 00:05:27Non-pathologic causes include poor venous return. 00:05:31Pathological causes include heart failure, kidney disease, tumors obstruct ologic causes include poor venous return. 00:05:31Pathological causes include heart failure, kidney disease, tumors obstructing the venous return. 00:05:38Lower extremity edema may be an early sign of heart failure. 00:05:41[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:43As I mentioned above, in ambulatory patients, fluid collects dependently in the lower extremities. 00:05:49In non0ambulatory patients, it collects in the sacral area. 00:05:53Non-pathological causes of edema include poor venous return in prolonged standing or sitting. 00:05:59Pathologic causes of edema result from right or left heart failure, kidney disease, liver disease, or tumors that obstruct venous return. 00:06:09One of the early signs of heart failure is pretibial and ankle edema. 00:06:14Kidney failure causes fluid retention. 00:  heart failure is pretibial and ankle edema. 00:06:14Kidney failure causes fluid retention. 00:06:16And hepatic disease may cause ascites, which contribute to peripheral edema. 00:06:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:27Peripheral edema may be associated with serious underlying disorders, such as venous insufficiency, congestive heart failure, DVT, and pulmonary hypertension. 00:06:36[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:38If the edema is unilateral, this raises concern for DVT, so you should assess whether there is a history of blood clotting disorders. 00:06:47If the edema is bilateral, this is usually in older adults and usually chronic and related to chronic venous disease, heart failure, medications, or pulmonary hypertension. 00:06:59Acute bilateral leg edema is rare and associated with medications, acute heart failure,  pulmonary hypertension. 00:06:59Acute bilateral leg edema is rare and associated with medications, acute heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, malignancy-related bilateral DVT. 00:07:08Finally, you should assess whether the edema is pitting or non-pitting. 00:07:13It's essential to consider the diagnosis of DVT in patients with acute unilateral or asymmetric leg edema. 00:07:20Peripheral edema can be pitting or non-pitting. 00:07:23Pitting edema is more common and is defined by the presence of tissue depression after pressure is applied to the area for at least five seconds. 00:07:33Pitting edema generally reflects the movement of the excess interstitial water in response to pressure. 00:07:39Non-pitting edema suggests lymphatic obstruction or hypothyroidism. 00:07:43[BLANK_AUDIO 9.7 Upper Gastrointestinal Symptoms00:00:01Lecture 9.7, the upper gastrointestinal symptoms.

00:00:53Dysphasia can sometimes be associated with nausea and vomiting. 00:00:57Dysphasia is difficulty swallowing and represents a loss of muscle control or an obstruction. 00:01:05Causes of muscle incoordination can include underlying disorders such as, myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, Parkinson's, dermatomyositis or poliomyelitis. 00:01:18Mechanical obstructions can include things like underlying causes such as cancer, peptic stricture secondary to gastroesophageal reflux disease or esophageal rings. 00:01:31Mechanical disorders are usually limited to solid food. 00:01:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01 Upper GI bowel function. 00:07:26Acholic stools are light gray or pale stools, and they may be associated with jaundice. 00:07:32They're also seen in viral hepatitis and pancreatic or duodenal cancer-related bile duct obstruction. 00:07:39If reported, ask about the duration, and any atypical urine color. 00:07:43Ask your patient about fever, especially chills, or right upper quadrant pain and/or history of biliary surgery. 00:07:51Any presence of anorexia malaise, or myalgias may suggest a viral hepatitis. 00:07:57Symptoms associated with jaundice may include pruritus, malaise, fever, chills, nausea, anorexia, change in the color of urine or feces, and abdominal pain. 00:08:08The medical history must address previous hepatic or biliary  of urine or feces, and abdominal pain. 00:08:08The medical history must address previous hepatic or biliary diseases, malignancy, hemolytic disorders, and surgery, as well as other potential contributing disorders, including congestive heart failure. 00:08:21Make sure to obtain a family history of hemolytic, biliary, and hepatic disorders. 00:08:27Obtain a thorough medication history, including over-the-counter and herbal agents. 00:08:31Determine the use of alcohol and recreational drugs, particularly IV drug use, and social risk factors for hepatitis, including sexual practices. 00:08:40[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com Mechanical disorders are usually limited to solid food. 00:01:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:35The history is particularly important in these patients because physical examination is really of little value when diagnosing dysphagia. 00:01:44Ask your patient whether they have difficulty swallowing only with liquids or does it also occur with solids, discern whether it is constant or intermittent. 00:01:54Ask your patient about a history of cancer, neuromuscular or autoimmune diseases or GERD. 00:02:00If the patient is elderly, inquire whether there have been frequent bouts of pneumonia or a chronic cough, which might alert you to aspiration as a cause. 00:02:09Ask your patient about any medications that they're currently on. 00:02:12The bisphosphonates a drug class used for treating osteoporosis can cause esophagitis especially if not taken with a full glass of water. 00:  for treating osteoporosis can cause esophagitis especially if not taken with a full glass of water. 00:02:23Ask about habits such as smoking and alcohol intake because cancers of the head and neck are more common in individuals with a history of tobacco and/or alcohol use or abuse. 00:02:33[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:40In your textbook, please take a look at Table 9.3. 00:02:44So where does the patient sense the difficulty swallowing is physically located? 00:02:49Is that difficulty associated with solids, liquids, or both? 00:02:52Is the difficulty swallowing associated with discomfort? 00:02:56Dysphagia is characterized as an esophageal transport disorder. 00:03:00And it's caused by lesions of the pharynx and esophagus, or by neuromuscular disorders that cause functional limitations. 00:03:  the pharynx and esophagus, or by neuromuscular disorders that cause functional limitations. 00:03:07It's important to differentiate between pre-esophageal dysphagia, which occurs mostly in patients with neuromuscular disorders, and esophageal disorders, which can include obstructive or motor disorders. 00:03:19[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:25Dyspepsia, common symptoms of dyspepsia are indigestion and heartburn. 00:03:30The causes can be organic, but they may also be difficult to ascertain. 00:03:35You might ask your patient, how long have you had these symptoms? 00:03:38Do you know what worsens or improves them? 00:03:40Are they constant? 00:03:42How are you currently treating your symptoms? 00:03:44Are there other symptoms associated with it? 00: :42How are you currently treating your symptoms? 00:03:44Are there other symptoms associated with it? 00:03:47Epigastric pain can represent the heartburn or dyspepsia often associated with gastro-esophageal reflux disease as well as several other diseases, including malignancies. 00:03:58The epigastric region is a very common site of discomfort, stemming from many digestive structures. 00:04:04Heartburn, often GERD, is a very common complaint. 00:04:08Patients may use alternative terms to describe the sensation of heartburn, including indigestion or sour stomach. 00:04:15Dyspepsia covers a variety of complaints that include heartburn, fullness, bloating, and upper abdominal pain. 00:04:22Because pain in this region provides little specificity on its own, the history is crucial in narrowing down the differential diagnosis for someone with dys  pain in this region provides little specificity on its own, the history is crucial in narrowing down the differential diagnosis for someone with dyspepsia. 00:04:30[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:36Dyspepsia additional examination. 00:04:38Have there been any changes in your patient's vital signs? 00:04:42Associated weight loss or abdominal mass may suggest malignancy. 00:04:46Abnormalities in skin tone may be associated with liver disease, cholecystitis or hypoxia related to cardiac or respiratory disease. 00:04:55Examination of abdominal sounds for an aortic bruit may be useful. 00:05:00Also, the presence of abdominal pain with palpation may be important. 00:05:04The patient should point to the exact location of their pain. 00:05:08Important considerations include vomiting, regurgitation, diaphoresis, dysphag  of their pain. 00:05:08Important considerations include vomiting, regurgitation, diaphoresis, dysphagia, blood in the stool or hematemesis. 00:05:16Shortness of breath fatigue, weight loss and radiation to other sites, including intro and extra abdominal sites. 00:05:23Ask your patient whether they're taking any new medications. 00:05:27Gastric ulcer symptoms may be worsened by eating, whereas eating may relieve symptoms related to other conditions. 00:05:34For example, duodenal ulcer symptoms may be relieved by food. 00:05:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:45Upper GI bowel function. 00:05:47Melena are black, tarry stools which represent bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal system. 00:05:54Ask your patient whether there's a prior history of melena. 00:05:57If reported, follow 05:54Ask your patient whether there's a prior history of melena. 00:05:57If reported, follow up questions related to the duration, does the patient feel lightheaded? 00:06:03Other associated symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, abdominal or back pain. 00:06:10Check for abdominal tenderness and look at the vital signs, establish the history of bowel movements, are there any indications of bleeding, including gums, bruising, etc? 00:06:20Black stools may also be associated, however, with Pepto-Bismol, black licorice, and some brands of chocolate cookies. 00:06:28When a patient presents with GI bleeding, the first step must be to determine his or her hemodynamic stability. 00:06:35Stability is assessed to a large extent by consideration of the patient's vital signs and their general appearance. 00:06:43Patients should be asked about  extent by consideration of the patient's vital signs and their general appearance. 00:06:43Patients should be asked about prior episodes of upper GI bleeding, since up to 60% of patients with a history of upper GI bleeding are bleeding from the same lesion. 00:06:53The timing and progression and description of the blood should also be noted. 00:06:58When melena is present, the blood is likely to have been present for over 14 hours. 00:07:03Therefore, the site of bleeding is most likely distant from the rectum, so it's most likely in the upper GI. 00:07:09The presence of abdominal pain, especially if severe and associated with rebound tenderness or involuntary guarding, raises concern for perforation. 00:07:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:24Upper GI bowel function. 00:07:26Acholic stools are light gray or pale stools, and 9.8 Lower Gastrointestinal Symptoms00:00:01Lecture 9.8 covers lower gastrointestinal symptoms. 00:00:09By the end of the lecture, you should be able to identify the important components of lower GI screening to be able to define hematochezia and describe follow up questions to ask a patient Who describes symptoms consistent with hematochezia. 00:00:24Describe follow-up questions related to constipation and describe follow-up questions related to diarrhea. 00:00:29[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:36Lower gastrointestinal screening for symptoms. 00:00:39Take a look at Box 9.8 in your textbook. 00:00:42The screening of the lower gastrointestinal tract is based on questions about bowel function including the color of stools the shape and the caliber of stools constipation diarrhea difficulty initiating a bowel movement and incontinence. 00:00:56[BLANK_AUD  stools constipation diarrhea difficulty initiating a bowel movement and incontinence. 00:00:56[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:01Hematochezia is the passage of bright red blood and stools, and if that's present, then you should ask your patient, how long has this been occurring? 00:01:10Is there any history of GI bleeding? 00:01:13Are there other symptoms associated with this, such as difficulty initiating bowel movements, or do they feel lightheaded? 00:01:20Is blood only in the stool or is there blood in the absence of stool? 00:01:25Make sure and check your patient's vital signs. 00:01:27Also inquire about medication use, including NSAIDs, anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents. 00:01:34Hematochezia or the passage of bright red blood in the stools usually originates in the left side 34Hematochezia or the passage of bright red blood in the stools usually originates in the left side of the colon, or the distal colon. 00:01:41Evaluation of a patient presenting with minimal bright red blood per rectum must be guided by the risk of underlying serious pathology. 00:01:51Causes may be grouped into anatomic, such as diverticulosis vascular which is angio, dysplasia, and inflammatory, such as infectious disease and neoplastic causes. 00:02:04In addition, acute lower GI bleeding can occur after therapeutic interventions such as polypectomy, benign ideologies are common and appear to account for 90% or more of all episodes of hematochezia. 00:02:18[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:26Continuing with hematochezia, systemic symptoms such as night sweats, fever, or weight loss suggest malignancy or chronic infection  hematochezia, systemic symptoms such as night sweats, fever, or weight loss suggest malignancy or chronic infection or inflammation. 00:02:37Diarrhea preceding or accompanying the passage of blood suggests colitis. 00:02:42Nonspecific abdominal pain indicates a process that may include but is not limited to the rectum. 00:02:48Lastly, change in the frequency or caliber of stools is suggestive of colonic malignancy. 00:02:54The presence of any of these symptoms suggests that further evaluation should be performed. 00:02:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:04Please take some time and look at table 9.4 in your textbook. 00:03:07If you suspect your patient is suffering from constipation, some follow up questions might be how long has this been going on, or asking your patient when was your last bowel movements? 00:03:17We're asking them  this been going on, or asking your patient when was your last bowel movements? 00:03:17We're asking them, do you experience constipation alternating with diarrhea? 00:03:22If this is the case, you may consider possible cancer or diverticulitis as a cause. 00:03:28You might ask your patient, are there any other symptoms associated with this, such as malaise, fatigue, abdominal fullness, fever, agitation, or altered mental status? 00:03:39Make sure to check vital signs. 00:03:41Also take a good history of medications, especially whether your patient is taking any opiates. 00:03:47Constipation is at some point experienced by almost everyone, but for some patients, it can represent serious underlying pathology. 00:03:55The associated symptoms described in the last question, represent potential manifestations of fecal impaction and should prompt immediate communication with the patient's physician. 00:04  last question, represent potential manifestations of fecal impaction and should prompt immediate communication with the patient's physician. 00:04:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:16If during your patient history you suspect that your patient may be suffering from diarrhea you might ask them, hw many episodes per day? 00:04:24How long have you been experiencing this? 00:04:26Was the onset gradual or sudden? 00:04:28Do you have a period when it alternates with constipation? 00:04:32Is it worse at certain times of the day? 00:04:35Do family members have similar symptoms? 00:04:38Any recent meals or travel that may be associated with these symptoms? 00:04:42Are there any other symptoms associated with this such as fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, confusion, abdominal pain or bloating? 00:04:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00: , vomiting, confusion, abdominal pain or bloating? 00:04:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:52The causes of diarrhea are numerous and include bacterial origin, viral, organic origin and functional. 00:04:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:01Most cases are self-limiting and resolve within days without medical intervention. 00:05:07However, when a high fever, intractable vomiting, or severe dehydration is present, prompt attention is necessary and hospitalization frequently is required, especially in children or geriatric patients. 00:05:20Dehydration and electrolyte depletion are concerns. 00:05:23Also, be aware that stress or anxiety could be a factor and psychosocial issues may be investigated. 00:05:29[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:35Constipation and diarrhea follow up. 00:05:38Make sure to examine vital signs, particularly determining the 05:35Constipation and diarrhea follow up. 00:05:38Make sure to examine vital signs, particularly determining the presence of fever, which might indicate infection, and tachycardia or orthostatic hypotension, which might indicate dehydration. 00:05:51Other signs of dehydration include dry mucous membranes, lightheadedness, syncope, lethargy and oliguria. 00:06:00If there is accompanying electrolyte imbalance, cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, tetany, or vascular collapse may occur, particularly in young children, the elderly, or patients who are already debilitated. 00:06:15Listen for hypoactive or hyperactive bowel sounds, which could indicate early obstruction. 00:06:20Also palpate for abdominal tenderness. 00:06:23This could indicate infection or inflammation

read from ingesting vegetable dyes, beets, or certain medications like Pyridium. 00:01:17Be aware that over the lifespan, storage, function, and bladder outlet obstruction for both genders varies. 00:01:24Bright red urine, may indicate urological or anatomic cause. 00:01:28While a tea colored or brown urine may be due to old clots, glomerulonephritis, or other medical causes. 00:01:34[ ? 00:08:05Also inquire about medical and surgical history. 00:08:09Ask about activities that seem to trigger urine loss and any efforts the patient has taken to avoid or adapt to the incontinence. 00:08:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:22I included this table of selected causes of urinary incontinence to give you an idea that there can be a number of different causes. 00:08:31There can be many different factors associated with the onset of urinary incontinence. 00:08:36So to summarize, obtain a thorough genitourinary history, including a detailed description of the type of incontinence experience. 00:08:44Ask about activities that seem to trigger urine loss and any efforts the patient has taken to avoid or adapt to the incontinence. 00:08:51[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:01Reproductive function, presence
