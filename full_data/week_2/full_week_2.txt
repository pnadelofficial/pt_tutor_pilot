2.1 Etiology of Joint PainEffects00:00:00[MUSIC] 00:00:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:11All right, so welcome to week two. 00:00:14And we'll be talking about recognizing atypical symptoms and signs. 00:00:18[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:23So we'll begin by discussing etiology of joint pain. 00:00:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:30And our objectives include identifying 6 conditions associated with joint pain. 00:00:36Describe why patient demographics may be important for diagnosing the cause of joint pain. 00:00:43Summarize how a patient's subjective description of their symptoms may help determine a diagnosis, including the mnemonic components of OPQRST. 00:00:54It's a pretty long mnemonic, but I'm hoping you're going QRST. 00:00:54It's a pretty long mnemonic, but I'm hoping you're going to find it useful. 00:00:58Patient demographics, medical history, and review of symptoms, make sure to look at your Boissonnault textbook Table 6.1, Box 6.1, Box 6.2, and Box 6.3. 00:01:10There are a lot of tables and boxes in this section of your text. 00:01:15So just prepare yourself for that. 00:01:18Conditions associated with joint pain include ankylosing spondylitis, gout, reactive arthritis, septic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis. 00:01:31Description of joint pain, patient demographics, and other health risk factors may provide clues related to development of a diagnosis or prognosis for a joint condition. 00:01:42  health risk factors may provide clues related to development of a diagnosis or prognosis for a joint condition. 00:01:42For example, rheumatoid arthritis is systemic while osteoarthritis is local. 00:01:48Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic illness, and it's often marked by extra articular manifestations. 00:01:55Osteoarthritis is a local, non-systemic bone and articular cartilage condition, and manifests none of the features shown in figure 6.1 in your text. 00:02:08The systemic nature of rheumatoid arthritis also accounts for constitutional complaints such as fatigue, low grade fever, and weight loss. 00:02:19So the symptoms should help you differentiate between osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. 00:02:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:29Etiology of joint pain. 00:02:31Understanding patient demographics is crucial AUDIO] 00:02:29Etiology of joint pain. 00:02:31Understanding patient demographics is crucial in identifying the risk of joint diseases as age of symptom onset and sex may affect the likelihood of having any given condition. 00:02:45Conditions like primary osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis often have specific age and sex-related patterns of symptom onset. 00:02:54Just like the last slide, paying attention to patient demographics and symptom patterns can give you a clue regarding differential diagnoses. 00:03:05Factors may include family history, health history, and viral infections. 00:03:11The presence of family history can be a significant risk factor, often seen in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. 00:03:21Health history is another critical component for a disease risk  lupus erythematosus. 00:03:21Health history is another critical component for a disease risk assessment, with lots of conditions tied to specific background risks, such as joint infection and autoimmune disorders. 00:03:32Viral infections, sunlight exposure, and the use of certain medications can all contribute to systemic lupus erythematosus. 00:03:41And this illustrates the complexity of health history as a risk determiner. 00:03:46The patient's symptom description. 00:03:48Important information can be learned just from a patient's description of their symptoms. 00:03:53A mnemonic O.P.Q.R.S.T can help you organize your approach to a patient's chief complaint. 00:04:02So a comprehensive examination of a patient's primary complaints involving details about the area and the nature of symptoms, the onset, aggravating and relieving factors, and daily pain  complaints involving details about the area and the nature of symptoms, the onset, aggravating and relieving factors, and daily pain variations can be crucial to informing your understanding of the patient's health status. 00:04:20With common symptomatic patterns and assumptions underpinning therapy approaches. 00:04:26So the mnemonic OPQRST symptom description, O is onset of symptoms, and then P is provocation and palliative, Q is quality. 00:04:37R is region and radiation, S is severity, and T is timing. 00:04:43So with O, the approach to a patient interview often involves starting with open-ended questions, followed by questions with increasing focus. 00:04:53The P is identifying what exacerbates or alleviate the patient's symptoms, and this can be very important for diagnosis and treatment. 00:05:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:03Q is requiring a detailed description of a  00:05:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:03Q is requiring a detailed description of a patient's pain and a comprehensive 24-hour report because this can indicate specific conditions. 00:05:13For example, gout is often characterized by a sudden onset and nighttime attacks while rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis often include extensive morning stiffness. 00:05:24And osteoarthritis might involve mild to moderate morning stiffness that relieves within 30 minutes of activity. 00:05:32But it could also present with nighttime discomfort. 00:05:36R, identifying the specific affected area, right, the region and radiation. 00:05:42Understanding the pattern of pain dispersion and the number of affected joints can really inform the cause of joint pain. 00:05:49Determining joint anatomical location and understanding patterns of affected joints can help guide your identification of underlying causes of the joint pain. Determining joint anatomical location and understanding patterns of affected joints can help guide your identification of underlying causes of the joint pain. 00:06:00For example, both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis commonly affects certain joints, like the hips and knees, but they exhibit very different patterns and involvement of other areas. 00:06:12S is severity. 00:06:14So assessing a patient's subjective pain intensity at its worst and at its best and maybe even the current level, even though it's not diagnostic and can provide you with some critical information. 00:06:27The timing, T, understanding whether the patient's status has been worsening, improving, or remaining consistent, can also provide you with very useful information as you're beginning to examine your patient. 00:06:41[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com o24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com 2.2 Physical Examination Limb Pain Dizziness00:00:01Okay, welcome to the next section, physical examination, limb pain, and dizziness. 00:00:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:10So our objectives for this section are to describe why identifying patterns and non joint related limb pain is critical for diagnosis. 00:00:18Identify components critical to examining a patient complaining of dizziness. 00:00:23Differentiate between central and peripheral causes of dizziness. 00:00:28Define disequilibrium including contributing factors. 00:00:32Describe symptoms, examination components, and potential causes of presyncope. 00:00:38Describe symptoms and examples of nonspecific dizziness. 00:00:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:45Physical examination. 00:00:48Comprehensive physical examination and observation can detect symptoms such as joint redness or swelling 45Physical examination. 00:00:48Comprehensive physical examination and observation can detect symptoms such as joint redness or swelling, potentially indicating a need for urgent physician referral. 00:00:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:00A thorough physical examination comprising system reviews and keen observation can underscore concerns raised during a patient history gathering. 00:01:10Symptoms such as joint redness, warmth, and edema, particularly in the absence of major trauma, may necessitate urgent physician referral. 00:01:18[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:21Physical examination, limb pain. 00:01:24Recognition to patterns and non-joint related limb pain is critical. 00:01:29Etiology of limb pain, conditions such as hypothyroidism and Lyme disease, among others, cause limb pain and share symptoms with treatable conditions. 00:01:39This necessitates in depth review of symptoms  the smooth pursuit neck torsion test can differentiate it from other dizziness causes. 00:08:09Treatment usually focuses on the underlying cervical disorder. 00:08:13[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com , cause limb pain and share symptoms with treatable conditions. 00:01:39This necessitates in depth review of symptoms to ensure accurate diagnosis. 00:01:45Hypothyroidism, Lyme disease, polymyalgia rheumatica, statin-induced myopathy all share these traits. 00:01:53They're all systemic in nature. 00:01:55They all generate musculoskeletal symptoms. 00:01:57And they all generate non-specific symptoms. 00:02:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:03Bilateral lower limb complaints could indicate central or systemic issues, while shifting limb pain without a mechanical cause may suggest conditions not typically managed by physical therapists. 00:02:15In which case the findings combined with their non mechanical symptoms Could cause you to think about or consider an urgent physician referral. 00:02:25Systemic origin. 00:02:26All these conditions result from systemic dys  urgent physician referral. 00:02:25Systemic origin. 00:02:26All these conditions result from systemic dysfunctions, whether hormonal, infectious, immune related, or drug induced musculoskeletal symptoms, these conditions can cause widespread musculoskeletal discomfort. 00:02:41Including limb pain, muscular weakness, stiffness or cramps. 00:02:46Nonspecific symptoms, these conditions often present with generalized nonspecific symptoms like fatigue, weight changes, fever or malaise, requiring thorough diagnostic measures to differentiate and confirm. 00:03:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:06Dizziness. 00:03:08Dizziness and vertigo are common complaints in medicine, especially in older populations. 00:03:14A precise description of the dizziness, its timeline, and associated complaints are critical in identifying a diagnosis. 00:03:21You should investigate balance and function. 00  timeline, and associated complaints are critical in identifying a diagnosis. 00:03:21You should investigate balance and function. 00:03:24Patient's past medical history, medications and lifestyle should all be considered. 00:03:30Investigation into balance and function particularly after head and neck movements can reveal signs of dizziness such as cord compression or cervical arterial dysfunction. 00:03:40With a lack of dizziness, not ruling out the possibility of cervical arterial dysfunction. 00:03:46A patient's medical history, medications, and lifestyle should all be considered with auto toxic medications and environmental factors, neurologic red flags and information about prior medical examinations, living conditions, and functional status. 00:04:02Playing pivotal roles in your evaluation process. 00:04:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:10Causes of dizziness, vertigo and peripheral vestibular disorders. 00:04:15Vertigo is caused by Causes of dizziness, vertigo and peripheral vestibular disorders. 00:04:15Vertigo is caused by asymmetric involvement of the vestibular system. 00:04:20Peripheral causes of vertigo involve the inner ear and nerve. 00:04:24Central causes originate in the brain, like multiple sclerosis, strokes, tumors, and migraines. 00:04:31Vertigo is caused by asymmetric involvement of the vestibular system, which includes the inner ear, vestibular nerve, brainstem, cerebellum, and cortex. 00:04:41Peripheral causes of vertigo involve the inner ear and nerve like benign paroxysmal positional vertigo BPPV, vestibular neuritis, menieres disease and acoustic neuroma. 00:04:54Central causes of dizziness originate in the brain, like multiple sclerosis, strokes, tumors, and migraines. 00:05:01Different iness originate in the brain, like multiple sclerosis, strokes, tumors, and migraines. 00:05:01Differentiating central from peripheral vertigo relies on associated symptoms and exam findings. 00:05:07The quality of vertigo, presence of neurologic signs, and characteristics of nystagmus. 00:05:13[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:18The consequences, vertigo, peripheral vestibular disorders. 00:05:23Central vertigo stems from the brain, causing severe imbalance, neurologic signs, less nausea and central misdiagnosis. 00:05:32Multiple sclerosis, strokes, cranial vertebral disorders, and tumors can all cause central positional vertigo and his diagnosis. 00:05:41Strokes affect circulation causing vertigo plus other neurologic signs like dysarthria and dysphagia. 00:05:48Migraines are associated with episodic vertigo, especially in children,  dysphagia. 00:05:48Migraines are associated with episodic vertigo, especially in children, but the mechanism is unclear. 00:05:54[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:01Dizziness disequilibrium. 00:06:04Disequilibrium refers to dizziness and imbalance without vertigo. 00:06:08Often from dysfunction in the vestibular, somatosensory, and visual systems or central areas like the cerebellum. 00:06:15Contributing factors include aging, neurologic disease, and biomechanical constraints. 00:06:23It's assessed via posturography testing of the balanced triad somatosensory, vestibular, and visual inputs. 00:06:29[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:34Physical examination, dizziness, presyncope. 00:06:37Presyncope is the feeling that you're about Physical examination, dizziness, presyncope. 00:06:37Presyncope is the feeling that you're about to faint. 00:06:40So symptoms might include a feeling of light-headedness. 00:06:43There's no illusion of motion like vertigo and there may be reduced cerebral blood flow. 00:06:49Cardiovascular causes include structural heart disease, coronary artery disease, and arrhythmias. 00:06:54Non-cardiovascular causes include orthostatic hypotension, hypoglycemia, hyperventilation, and possibly medications. 00:07:02[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:08These examination should include orthostatic vitals, Cardiac auscultation, ECG, and even tilt table testing. 00:07:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:20Physical examination nonspecific dizziness. 00:07:23Psychiatric disorders like anxiety, ] 00:07:20Physical examination nonspecific dizziness. 00:07:23Psychiatric disorders like anxiety, panic, and phobias are associated with dizziness especially in social settings. 00:07:31Depression as a cause is a little less clear. 00:07:35Patients report subjective sensations like floating, rocking or internal spinning. 00:07:40Phobic postural vertigo may result in dizziness and unsteadiness without objective findings. 00:07:46Cervicogenic dizziness, involves dizziness associated with neck dysfunction like pain and decreased range of motion. 00:07:53It may be seen with whiplash injuries or cervical degeneration. 00:07:57Cervical genetic dizziness as a diagnosis of exclusion after ruling out other causes. 00:08:04Tests like the smooth pursuit neck torsion test can differentiate it from other dizziness causes. 00:08:09Treatment usually 2.3 Physical Examination Headache00:00:00Okay, welcome back to week 2, lecture number 3, physical examination, headache. 00:00:06Objectives for this lecture include describe the etiology of cervicogenic, migraines, tension, cluster headaches, and giant cell arteritis. 00:00:16Describe typical symptoms of a migraine headache. 00:00:20Headaches are very common with a lifetime prevalence of over 90% in both men and women. 00:00:24I'm sure most of you have experienced a headache. 00:00:28There are frequent comorbidity seen in outpatient physical therapy and occupational therapy clinics, etiology of headaches, cervicogenic migraines, and cluster. 00:00:38Cervicogenic headaches arise from neck tissues like facettes and muscles causing unilateral head pain starting in the neck. 00:00:45Migraines are often unilateral but they can shift from  unilateral head pain starting in the neck. 00:00:45Migraines are often unilateral but they can shift from side to side between attacks. 00:00:51Tension headaches are bilateral and often described as a vise like band. 00:00:55Cluster headaches come in severe unilateral pain clusters and they can last 15 minutes to three hours with autonomic features like tearing and congestion. 00:01:06Provocation with neck movements helps diagnose cervicogenic headache. 00:01:11Migraines may be associated with nausea. 00:01:14Sensitivity to light or sound and throbbing pain that prevents formal activity. 00:01:19Tension headaches may be associated with life stressors and are usually milder than migraines. 00:01:25Continuing with etiology of headaches including arteritis migraines and continued tension headache discussion. 00:01:32Giant cell arteritis causes new onset of temporal headache  migraines and continued tension headache discussion. 00:01:32Giant cell arteritis causes new onset of temporal headache and jaw or neck pain. 00:01:37It can result in vision changes, fever, and even weight loss may occur. 00:01:43Migraines may present with or without aura, and may be preceded up to 48 hours by symptoms such as fatigue, altered mood, or changes in appetite. 00:01:52They also can include prodromal symptoms. 00:01:56Tension headaches lack the associated symptoms of migraines. 00:02:00Giant cell arteritis is a vasculitis, eventually resulting in artery luminal occlusion. 00:02:07The resultant vascular stenosis can cause permanent visual loss if the cranial arteries are involved and the inflammation can lead to aortic dissection. 00:02:17Blood vessels typically involved include the medium and large vessels originating from the a  aortic dissection. 00:02:17Blood vessels typically involved include the medium and large vessels originating from the aortic arch. 00:02:23The inflammation is likely to be segmental, skipping portions of the vessel. 00:02:29The chief complaint will be a new onset of unilateral headache, often described as new or unfamiliar to the patient. 00:02:36Pain will be localized to the temporal regions and the therapist may even observe a bulging vessel in this area. 00:02:43Suspicion of giant cell arteritis should result in strong consideration of urgent referral. 00:02:49The duration of migraine symptoms varies from a few to up to 72 hours in length. 00:02:56Addressing the underlying life stressors may be important when treating things like tension headaches. 00:03:02In summary, the literature documents cases where patients presenting to physical therapy were found to have serious undiagnosed pathology upon therapist examination  summary, the literature documents cases where patients presenting to physical therapy were found to have serious undiagnosed pathology upon therapist examination. 00:03:13And this underscores the need For the therapists to be familiar with red flags. 00:03:18Providers must understand the key features distinguishing musculoskeletal conditions suitable for conservative therapy. 00:03:25Versus those requiring urgent physician referral to ensure timely diagnosis and management. 00:03:32So we've covered a framework for generating a broad differential based on symptoms that the clinician should refine using history and examination to determine the need for escalation of care. 00:03:43The medical literature contains numerous case reports of patients presenting to physical therapy with common musculoskeletal complaints like arthrology of joint pain or dizziness. 00:03:53Who were subsequently found to have a cold serious pathology upon examination by the therapist. 00:04:00It's important for providers to be aware of the  a cold serious pathology upon examination by the therapist. 00:04:00It's important for providers to be aware of the risk factors clinical features and patterns of presentation that could distinguish musculoskeletal conditions. 00:04:09That may be treated conservatively through physical therapy from those requiring urgent or emergent physician referral. 00:04:17An understanding of red flag pathology is critical to ensure timely diagnosis and management of potentially life threatening disease processes. 00:04:26This information presented here and in your textbook provides a framework for generating differential diagnoses based on the patient's reported symptoms. 00:04:35The onus is then on the clinician to corroborate or refute elements of that differential based on a careful history taking and physical examination. 00:04:44Any findings suggestive of serious pathology should prompt you to escalate care and immediately consult with the appropriate medical specialists. 00:04:53[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’  the appropriate medical specialists. 00:04:53[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in
