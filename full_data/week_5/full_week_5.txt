5.1 Fractures and ComplicationsEffects00:00:00[MUSIC] 00:00:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:10So this is lecture 5.1 Open and Closed Fractures and Complications. 00:00:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:25And objectives for this lecture include describe complications of fractures that could become life threatening and define open versus closed fracture. 00:00:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:40So let's start by talking about fractures from trauma. 00:00:44So imaging of musculoskeletal trauma is performed by radiography, usually X-ray. 00:00:50And the therapist should be aware of what imaging was performed at the emergency department, and this is called a primary trauma survey. 00:00:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:03For example, here, a primary trauma survey :00:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:03For example, here, a primary trauma survey for a motor vehicle accident or a fall may include a cross-table lateral of the cervical spine. 00:01:13And this is to assess for gross instability, fractures, or dislocations. 00:01:17It may also include an AP view of the chest to assess for hemothorax, or pneumothorax, or pulmonary contusion. 00:01:24And it may also include an AP of the pelvis to assess for fractures or hemorrhage. 00:01:29So the primary trauma survey is a series of images to assist with screening and prioritizing patients multiple injuries. 00:01:37The goal is to avoid subjecting a trauma patient to multiple radiographic examinations and instead to quickly screen them for life-threatening injuries. 00:01:47Usually with a CT scan because the CT in the emergency department decreases  them for life-threatening injuries. 00:01:47Usually with a CT scan because the CT in the emergency department decreases assessment time and it also decreases the chance of missing a fracture. 00:01:56And it helps prioritize treatment of the patient. 00:01:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:03Now, some fractures can cause serious complications. 00:02:06So those are fractures which can cause a hemorrhage such as the fracture of a pelvis or the femur. 00:02:13Or fractures which can cause a fat embolism, which is a multiple crushing type injury. 00:02:18Fractures which cause neurovascular damage, which is fractures to the spine, or the elbow, or the proximal humerus. 00:02:25So although orthopedic conditions are not usually the priority in a major trauma case. 00:02:31If there are some conditions that by themselves require  are not usually the priority in a major trauma case. 00:02:31If there are some conditions that by themselves require urgent action to prevent serious complications. 00:02:37Fractures that can cause hemorrhage, fat embolism, or neurovascular damage, or immediate treatment. 00:02:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:48What is a fracture? 00:02:50A fracture is a break in the structural continuity of bone or cartilage. 00:02:54In the radiology report, fractures are described using anatomic and standardized terms. 00:03:00So eponyms such as Colles fracture or as we mentioned in one of our earlier lectures, that boxer's fracture may be used in some communications. 00:03:09But generally, these eponyms are avoided in radiologic description, because they're not descriptive enough and they can be misinterpreted. 00:03:18So here's a fractured  description, because they're not descriptive enough and they can be misinterpreted. 00:03:18So here's a fractured ulna in the AP view, and you can see that here. 00:03:25[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:03:27And usually this fracture is due to a blow to the forearm. 00:03:30Now the image on the right is a lateral view and that reveals the head of the radius. 00:03:40Lets's see that here, and the head of the radius is displaced. 00:03:43A failure to recognize this abnormality can result in death of the radial head with subsequent elbow dysfunction. 00:03:51This illustrates the importance of always, always obtaining two views of a bone in an injury. 00:03:56[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:02So closed versus open fracture. 00:04:06So a fracture, as we said, is a :04:02So closed versus open fracture. 00:04:06So a fracture, as we said, is a break in the structural continuity of bone or cartilage. 00:04:10A closed fracture, the skin and the tissue overlying the fracture are intact. 00:04:17And in an open fracture, the skin is perforated or broken, so regardless of the size of the wound. 00:04:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:25Okay, we have that this is open fracture. 00:04:28So a basic clinical distinction in defining fractures is whether or not the fracture site is exposed to the external environment. 00:04:36In the past, the term simple and compound were used because the terms weren't used reliably simple and compound are no longer used, and diagnostic coding terminology. 00:04:46And they've been replaced with closed and open fracture. 00:04:49[BLANK . 00:04:46And they've been replaced with closed and open fracture. 00:04:49[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | whatâ€™s in your video? | cielo24.com 5.2 7 Elements of a FractureEffects00:00:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:01So this is lecture 5.2, the 7 elements of a fracture. 00:00:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:09And so our objective here is to identify the 7 elements that describe a fracture. 00:00:15[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:18So the 7 elements of a fracture include, number 1, the anatomic site and the extent of the fracture, the type of the fracture, whether it's complete or incomplete, the alignment of the fracture fragments, the direction of the fracture line. 00:00:35Number 5, special features of the fracture such as impaction or avulsion. 00:00:40Number 6, associated abnormalities, such as a joint dislocation. 00:00:45And number 7, special types of fractures resulting from abnormal stress or pathological  as a joint dislocation. 00:00:45And number 7, special types of fractures resulting from abnormal stress or pathological processes in the bone, such as stress fractures or pathological fractures. 00:00:55[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:00So the first element is the anatomic site and extent of the fracture. 00:01:05So bones may be referenced by standard anatomic landmarks or parts, like the surgical neck of the humerus or the intertrochanteric region of the femur, or the supracondylar area of a distal femur. 00:01:19The shaft of a long bone is divided into thirds and the junctions between each of those regions. 00:01:25The ends of the long bones are classified as the distal and the proximal end, with each end then divided into extra-articular, the outside articular surface or outside the joint ,and the intra-art :08:14The elbow and the wrist joints are oriented perpendicular to each other in this case, right? 00:08:18So if this is going straight into the page right here this is going along that way. 00:08:25So they are perpendicular to each other in this case. 00:08:29Now, this image on the right here, that's plate and screw fixation two months later, right, so we can see the hardware. 00:08:35And a few lectures ago, we talked about how you can see, even when you remove the hardware, you'll still be able to see some changes in the bone once that hardware is removed. 00:08:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:53So in the seven elements of fracture description number four, the direction of the fracture lines. 00:09:00And these are described in reference to the longitudinal axis of a long bone. 00:09:05So we 09:00And these are described in reference to the longitudinal axis of a long bone. 00:09:05So we have transverse here and longitudinal here and oblique here, sort of, and then spiral here, which is that. 00:09:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:22So the transverse is usually a result of a bending force, and it occurs at a right angle to the longitudinal axis. 00:09:30And so you have a force, for example, directed this way. 00:09:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:39Then a longitudinal, that force is generally parallel to the shaft of the bone. 00:09:46And the oblique, it's a diagonally oriented fracture and the result of combined compression bending and rotation. 00:09:56So you have a whole bunch of things going on in the oblique, right? 00:10:00So you 56So you have a whole bunch of things going on in the oblique, right? 00:10:00So you have again, you have this compression. 00:10:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:06And you have the bending, which is probably taking place, for example that. 00:10:13And you have some sort of rotational force. 00:10:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:21And finally, in spiral you have a fracture that spirals around the long axis due to a rotational force. 00:10:28So spiral and oblique can appear similar but spiral fractures have a vertical segment and sharp jagged edges. 00:10:35Spiral fractures heal more easily than oblique fractures because the fragments fit together and when they do, there's greater stability and they heal more quickly. 00:10:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:53  greater stability and they heal more quickly. 00:10:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:53So, in this image, we're looking at, on the left, an oblique fracture at the mid-diaphysis of the tibia, right here. 00:11:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:03And then, on the right, we're looking at a spiral fracture displaced an overlapping of the mid-femoral shaft on the right. 00:11:11So we can see here is one segment [INAUDIBLE] of the other segment. 00:11:21And so oblique fractures generally occur on a plane that's oblique to the long axis of the bone. 00:11:27And these are prone to angulation and you can see that any of the angulation and where the distal portion of the bone points off in a different direction. 00:11:38And note  angulation and where the distal portion of the bone points off in a different direction. 00:11:38And note the sharp edges on the spiral fracture, okay, that's really sharp, and how they might fit together more easily. 00:11:48The spiral fractures are also usually the result of a high energy trauma, and often they're associated with displacement. 00:11:55[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:02So continuing with the direction of fracture lines, we have comminuted fractures. 00:12:07We can see these different versions of comminuted fractures. 00:12:13They're fractures with more than two fragments. 00:12:15And so some commonly occurring comminuted fracture patterns are on the far left. 00:12:21This is a wedge shaped or butterfly pattern in the center here, B, we have a two or three segmented level fracture, right? 00:12:29One  the center here, B, we have a two or three segmented level fracture, right? 00:12:29One, two, three, four. 00:12:33[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:35And then other fractures can occur with multiple fragments, be it several or several hundred, and they're still described as comminuted. 00:12:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:50So this slide demonstrates comminated fractures with a proximal tibia and patella. 00:12:55So we can see here an A, this is an AP radiograph of the knee and we can see fractures at the proximal tibia and patella. 00:13:03So we can see fracture fragments here, anocracy fractured by patela, all right,? 00:13:11And B we have an axial CT demonstrating fractures of the patella and the posterolateral fem :13:11And B we have an axial CT demonstrating fractures of the patella and the posterolateral femoral condyle. 00:13:20So we can see these fractures here, and the patella we can see multiple fractures here. 00:13:28And then finally at C we can look at this axial CT which shows comminated fractures of a proximal tibia. 00:13:36And again, we can see all these little fractures here. 00:13:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:44So the comminuted fractures are usually the result of extremely high energy loads, and these include crushing forces from motor vehicle accidents. 00:13:53Overall, though, in a nutshell, I think what you should take away is that a comminated fracture describes any fracture that involves more than two fragments. 00:14:02[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:05So the presence  more than two fragments. 00:14:02[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:05So the presence of special features number five, on the left, we have impaction. 00:14:12[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:16And on the right we have avulsion. 00:14:19[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:21And we can see in this MRI image here, this is impaction where this vertebral body has been smooshed. 00:14:32So, the special features of fractures include impaction, which is seen in A and that's a compression fracture of the vertebral body. 00:14:41And that's the result of forces related to axial loading when a bone is driven into itself. 00:14:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:49The other example is B which is an avulsion. 00:14:53And AUDIO] 00:14:49The other example is B which is an avulsion. 00:14:53And that's seen in this image where medial malleolar of motion occurred due to the result of an e-version force trauma at the ankle. 00:15:05And it's usually the result of tensile loading of the bone at the attachment site of a tendon ligaments, it's occurring right here. 00:15:14With the compression forces, the common areas are generally vertebral bodies here, but the other place it can occur is when we imagine the femur and, 00:15:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:15:30The tibia. 00:15:31[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:15:33And when the femur is driven down into the tibia, you can have, again an impaction fracture right there, along the tibial plateau. 00:15:45[  you can have, again an impaction fracture right there, along the tibial plateau. 00:15:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:15:50And so continuing with the presence of special features on the right here we are seeing an avulsion. 00:15:56And this is the lateral view of a foot that's an avulsion fracture of the calcaneal tuberosity. 00:16:02And the avulsed fragment has migrated superiorly because the now unattached tendon has recoiled, pulling that fragment with it. 00:16:11And the dotted lines indicate the normal contact areas of the fragment to the main body of the bone. 00:16:17So this attaches here, and this attaches here, and it should fit in there like a nice little puzzle piece, but it's been torn away by the tendon that attaches right there. 00:16:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:16:40  each end then divided into extra-articular, the outside articular surface or outside the joint ,and the intra-articular, so within the articular surface or within the joint surface area. 00:01:44And fractures can extend from the extra-articular area to the intra-articular area. 00:01:50And so we can see in this bone diagram. 00:01:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:55Now, we have the extra-articular surface here and the intra-articular surface. 00:02:00And this is intra-articular because we can imagine here's the pelvis, and so this area is inside the joint. 00:02:07This is the proximal end of the femur, and then down here is the distal end of the femur. 00:02:12[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:19So in these images on the top  by the tendon that attaches right there. 00:16:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:16:40So number six, associated abnormalities, subluxations and dislocations of related joints are probably the most common injuries of soft tissue associated with fracture. 00:16:52So involvement in nearby soft tissues is also common, such as disruption of the joint capsules and the ligaments and the interosseous membrane between the long bones of the forearm or the tibial fibular syndesmosis. 00:17:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:17:12So here's an example of the associated abnormalities, and this is a posterior elbow dislocation. 00:17:19And so the posterior dislocation of the elbow occurred in this 39 year old man who injured his elbow falling from a skateboard. 00:17:28And A here is a lateral view of the elbow before reduction. 00:17:33And that demonstrates the 17:28And A here is a lateral view of the elbow before reduction. 00:17:33And that demonstrates the posterior position of the radius and ulna in relationship with the distal humerus, right? 00:17:40So here's the ulna and the radius, and they should be up this way. 00:17:48You can also see the fractured fragment over here. 00:17:51[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:17:53Now in B here and C, we can see that the fracture has been reduced and we see now better positioning of the joints, and we also see multiple fracture fragments in the soft tissue. 00:18:08And that's what these arrows are here, right? 00:18:11So fracture fragments here and down here. 00:18:15And also note the swelling of the joint and that's seen best on the lateral view because of the acute trauma. 00:18:22  the swelling of the joint and that's seen best on the lateral view because of the acute trauma. 00:18:22So that's [INAUDIBLE], and you can see how fluffy that is. 00:18:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:18:37So number 7, special types of fractures resulting from abnormal stress or pathological processes in the bones, such as stress fractures or pathological fractures. 00:18:48So stress fractures appear as a regular localized areas of more radio dense area and they represent the bones ongoing attempts at repair, right? 00:18:59So we see increased bone activity and so the image appears brighter in that area. 00:19:03The initial radiographs often appear normal, making that diagnosis difficult so there may not be evidence, for example, of a fracture line or periosteal reaction for up to six weeks. 00:19:14So we can imagine, for example, someone with a bone stress injury  for up to six weeks. 00:19:14So we can imagine, for example, someone with a bone stress injury and they're complaining of discomfort, but we see nothing on imaging until maybe six weeks after the onset. 00:19:25And pathological fractures occur in bone that has been structurally weakened by some sort of pathological process. 00:19:34So that could be a result of osteoporosis or Paget's disease or osteogenesis imperfecta, tumor infections, disuse, etc. 00:19:41Periprosthetic fractures can also occur interoperatively or around the prosthetic components even years after surgery. 00:19:50Bone graft fractures can also occur spontaneously, even two to three years after implantation, and that may not even be related to trauma. 00:19:58The occurrence of those fractures could be as high as 40%, and this increases exponentially in plate patients with plate fixation hardware or patients who are undergoing chemotherapy. 00:  as high as 40%, and this increases exponentially in plate patients with plate fixation hardware or patients who are undergoing chemotherapy. 00:20:10[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:20:19So here we're looking at a stress fracture and on the left is the calcaneus of a runner. 00:20:25And we can see the small lucency in the posterior superior calcaneal cortex. 00:20:30And this calcaneus is actually a common location of stress fracture. 00:20:34In this case, the patient had a history of overuse, having started running long distances regularly. 00:20:41And you can see that here, so we notice a break in the continuity of the cortex of this calcaneus right here. 00:20:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:20:53And then on the other side on the right, there's a transverse fracture of the radial shaft near the junction of 53And then on the other side on the right, there's a transverse fracture of the radial shaft near the junction of the proximal and mid-thirds, so we can see that right here. 00:21:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:21:08And significant cortical thickening is seen throughout the shaft of the radius. 00:21:12And that's probably in response to the kind of training that the cheerleader's doing. 00:21:16So the stress fracture of the radial shaft in a cheerleader, this one is related to repeated full weight bearing on the hand during acrobatics or during training and performing. 00:21:26So the adaptive cortical thickening, or I should say the cortical thickening is an adaptive response to the load that's been placed through the radial shaft. 00:21:37And so that thickening here, and we can see how white, And how wide that white band is, that cortical 37And so that thickening here, and we can see how white, And how wide that white band is, that cortical thickening, and that predates the fracture. 00:21:51And so that cortical thickening is the bone's response to that repeated stress and that occurs with training for cheerleading. 00:22:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:22:09Okay, so in this set of two images, we're looking at stress fractures. 00:22:13And on the left is a femoral neck stress fracture in a novice runner and on the right is a severe femoral neck stress fracture and a jogger. 00:22:26On the left, we have this area of sporadic bone, this sort of white bone here, very active bone turnover, and that's seen at the base of the femoral neck. 00:22:39This is a new runner with hip pain, so that finding is generally diagnostic of a stress  neck. 00:22:39This is a new runner with hip pain, so that finding is generally diagnostic of a stress fracture of the femur. 00:22:48And then on the right side, we see an area of lucency, right, a darker area. 00:22:54That's right here, that's where we see that darkness. 00:22:58Right, and that's surrounded by this sclerotic bone here. 00:23:05And this is a jogger with hip pain and this is a severe femoral neck stress fracture on the right. 00:23:12So I'll go ahead and erase that so you can see it better again here. 00:23:17And again, what I'd like you to take away from this is just noting this sclerotic area here, right? 00:23:26That bone is very active responding to that fracture. 00:23:30And on the left where not :23:26That bone is very active responding to that fracture. 00:23:30And on the left where not only do we see that sclerotic area, but we also see that linear lucency, that darker area here, this is a more severe stress fracture. 00:23:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:23:46Now this is an image of a pathological fracture, osteogenesis imperfecta. 00:23:52And this is a pathological fracture through the distal third of the olecranon in a 26 year old man as you can see by the arrows right here. 00:24:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:24:03And the underlying pathology here is osteogenesis imperfecta. 00:24:07And that's a disease that's characterized by abnormal maturation of collagen affecting both the intramembranous and endochondral bone formation. 00:24:18So note the diffuse  affecting both the intramembranous and endochondral bone formation. 00:24:18So note the diffuse decrease in bone density. 00:24:23The very thin cortices and the flared metastases and a cystic appearance of their proximal ends of the radius of ulna. 00:24:32All right, so we can see this kind of mushroomy appearance here of the radius and maybe of ulna a little bit too, but we can also see how easy it is to see through this bone 00:24:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:24:55Right, just a decrease in bone density throughout here. 00:24:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:25:05Really a tragic disease. 00:25:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:25:12So, in these two images, we're looking again at pathological fracture, but these images represent the fracture as a result of . 00:02:12[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:19So in these images on the top, we see an intra-articular fracture, and in the bottom, we see an extra-articular fracture. 00:02:28So this is an AP view of a knee with a distal femur fracture that is intra-articular. 00:02:34The fracture extends through the intracondylar notch and the medial condyle is displaced medially and inferiorly. 00:02:42So the fracture is right through here, right, extends through the intracondylar notch, right there, and the medial condyle is displaced medially, which is that way ,and inferiorly, which is that way. 00:03:02The bottom is a fracture of the distal femur, but this fracture does not involve the joint space and is therefore considered extra-articular. 00:03:11The fracture So, in these two images, we're looking again at pathological fracture, but these images represent the fracture as a result of metastases. 00:25:22And so these represent a pathological fracture of the femoral neck. 00:25:26And so in the image on the left A here, this is a bone scan. 00:25:31And this image reveals metastatic lesions caused by breast cancer. 00:25:38So increased uptake of the tracer is normally seen at the injection site right here, right where they inject the tracer, and also at the bladder here. 00:25:47Because that tracer is going to be excreted, but the other dark spot, it's abnormal. 00:25:53And that represents an increased uptake of the tracer by cancerous lesion. 00:25:57And that's right here. 00:25:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:26:01Okay. And that's right here. 00:25:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:26:01Okay. 00:26:02[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:26:11And so the tumor at the proximal femur weakens the bone, and as a result of that weakening, the bone is fractured here, right? 00:26:21[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:26:29And so, here we're looking at a periprosthetic fracture and on the left side, we're looking at a distal femur with the component intact. 00:26:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:26:41And, 00:26:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:26:44On the right side, we can see, 00:26:47[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:26:50There's that fracture. 00:26:51And we can see BLANK_AUDIO] 00:26:50There's that fracture. 00:26:51And we can see a little bit on the left, right? 00:26:56The component is still intact, but we can see that fracture present there. 00:27:00[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | whatâ€™s in your video? | cielo24.com  but this fracture does not involve the joint space and is therefore considered extra-articular. 00:03:11The fracture line is above the condyles. 00:03:14And so here we see this fracture. 00:03:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:21Right, and so we can also see here that the alignment, 00:03:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:26Is just off a little bit. 00:03:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:35So the second element of fractures, here we have the type of fracture. 00:03:41And on the left, we can see a complete fracture, and on the right is an incomplete fracture. 00:03:47So I think the takeaways here are, in a complete fracture, one bone has become two fracture fragments, right, 1, 2. 00:03:58Now, if the bone , one bone has become two fracture fragments, right, 1, 2. 00:03:58Now, if the bone becomes more than two fragments, then the fracture is considered comminuted. 00:04:04While in an incomplete fracture, one cortical margin remains intact, and we still have one bone because only one portion of the cortex was disrupted. 00:04:14So on the right side here, we can see that this remains intact, while this side here is disrupted. 00:04:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:26So incomplete fractures are relatively stable, and they may maintain their position if stresses placed on them are minimized. 00:04:34So usually, incomplete fractures occur in short bones, also in irregular-shaped bones and flat bones. 00:04:40[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:48So in this image, we're looking at a complete fracture of the distal radius and an incomplete  00:04:48So in this image, we're looking at a complete fracture of the distal radius and an incomplete fracture of the distal ulna, okay? 00:04:56And so the distal radius here, you can see one part is here and the other part is there. 00:05:06That's a complete fracture. 00:05:08And the ulna, we have an incomplete fracture, because look at this cortical margin, it's still intact whereas on this side, it is not intact. 00:05:21So this is a complete transverse fracture of the distal right radial metadiaphysis, with posterolateral displacement by one shaft width. 00:05:32So you can see here this, 00:05:35[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:37And shift it over by about the width of the shaft. 00:05:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05  it over by about the width of the shaft. 00:05:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:44And then there's an associated buckle fracture of the distal ulna, the slight radial angulation. 00:05:50And so that's right here, this is the buckle fracture, and you can see how the ulna sort of buckled over that way. 00:05:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:01The distal radioulnar joint alignment appears preserved, and so that's right here. 00:06:07Well, that's a mess down there, but I think you get the idea 00:06:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:19So 7 elements of a fracture, number 3 is the alignment of the fracture fragments. 00:06:27And so over here in A, we have nondisplaced. 00:06:32We have a medial displacement :27And so over here in A, we have nondisplaced. 00:06:32We have a medial displacement. 00:06:35We have a lateral displacement going this way. 00:06:38We have distracted. 00:06:42We have overriding and posterior superior displacement down here, and we have distracted and rotated. 00:06:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:54So alignment position is described based on the position of the distal fragment in relation to the proximal fragment. 00:07:02So non-displaced fractures have some degree of contact between the fracture fragments versus displaced fractures. 00:07:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:18So in these images, we're looking at complete fractures of the right radius and the ulna, and we have one shaft width of ulnar and dorsal superior displacement, and there's also 90 degrees of rotation of both fractures. 00:07  shaft width of ulnar and dorsal superior displacement, and there's also 90 degrees of rotation of both fractures. 00:07:33And so the distal segment describes the alignment of the fracture, right? 00:07:37And so this is the distal segment, and the distal fragment of ulna and radius have moved in the ulna direction. 00:07:44It may have also migrated superiorly. 00:07:49So there's one shaft width of ulna and volar displacement of the radial fracture, right? 00:07:55So that's the end of this one. 00:07:58And there's 90 degrees of rotation of both fractures. 00:08:02So the elbow and the elbow, we can imagine that this is going straight into the image, right, straight backwards going that way. 00:08:14The elbow and the wrist joints are oriented perpendicular to each other in this case, right? 00:08 5.3 Fractures in Children00:00:01Hi, so we're continuing care with 5.3, fractures in children and the Salter-Harris classification. 00:00:11So our objectives for 5.3 are first to describe the unique patterns of injury and special problems and diagnosis treatment and healing of fractures in children. 00:00:22And then second, to define the Salter-Harris classification system. 00:00:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:29So fractures of children, these are complicated by features that resemble a fracture, right? 00:00:34Like growth plate for both lines, secondary centers of ossification, and then also large nutrient parameter. 00:00:43So all of the above things can be confused with fracture lines. 00:00:46And so therefore, comparison films of the uninvolved side are also very useful. 00:00:51And we mentioned this in a prior lecture  comparison films of the uninvolved side are also very useful. 00:00:51And we mentioned this in a prior lecture. 00:00:53I mentioned this in a prior lecture, that symmetry is really your friend when doing some of these images. 00:01:00Comparing one extremity to the other, 00:01:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:07An additional difficulty in radiographically examining immature bone, is that only the ossified portions of the bone have sufficient radiographic density to be imaged. 00:01:19So the preformed cartilage is not imaged. 00:01:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:26So elements of fracture description in addition to the 7 criteria that we talked about earlier. 00:01:34Number 8 in children are patterns of incomplete shaft fractures. 00:01:39And number 9, which occur in children are features of fractures of the ep s in your video? | cielo24.com  of incomplete shaft fractures. 00:01:39And number 9, which occur in children are features of fractures of the epiphysis and the epiphyseal plate. 00:01:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:50So these are patterns of incomplete fractures in children. 00:01:56So first on the left, a green stick fracture. 00:01:59And this depicts the appearance of the incomplete fracture here. 00:02:04And the shaft is fractured on the tension side over here whereas the cortex and the periosteum remain intact on the compression side over here. 00:02:19So next in the middle, we have the torus fracture. 00:02:24And this term is also common and describes an impaction fracture that results in the buckling of the cortex. 00:02:32So you can see this buckling here. 00:02:35The occurs predominantly at the metaph  00:02:32So you can see this buckling here. 00:02:35The occurs predominantly at the metaphyseal regions, which are predisposed to a compressive response because of the amount of cancellous bone and newly remodeled trabecular bone present. 00:02:48Occasionally this kind of fracture is seen in adults if an underlying pathology exists. 00:02:55So again, in the torus, fraction of what we're looking for is this sort of buckling right in here. 00:03:01So plastic bowling on the far right. 00:03:04And this is the result of the unique biomechanical nature of developing bone. 00:03:09So when longitudinal compression forces are imposed on a naturally curved tubular growing bone. 00:03:17And those forces exceed the point in which the bone returns to its prior position. 00:03:23That bone becomes plastically deformed or bowed  point in which the bone returns to its prior position. 00:03:23That bone becomes plastically deformed or bowed. 00:03:27And so we've seen a few images in prior lectures where we see this sort of bowing occurring. 00:03:33One in particular where we saw it in both the femur and the tibia of a young patient. 00:03:39And so plastic bowing means that even when the force is removed, the bone remains bowed. 00:03:46So plastic bowing is a type of incomplete fracture because microscopic fatigue lines or microfractures are still evident in this plastically deformed bone. 00:03:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:00So, features of fractures of the epiphysis and epiphyseal plate. 00:04:05And these are Salter-Harris classification of physio fractures. 00:04:13And so, here's :05And these are Salter-Harris classification of physio fractures. 00:04:13And so, here's a mnemonic, Salter. 00:04:15And so, type I is straight across. 00:04:20Type II is above, right? 00:04:22So if we look at the green line. 00:04:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:26Type II is A, and that's above type III. 00:04:29So SAL number 3 is lower or below, and you can see how it crosses through and goes below that green line. 00:04:40And Type IV is two or through, which means it goes all the way from above, down, and through. 00:04:49And then type V is erasure of the growth plate or a crush. 00:04:54And so now that growth plate is gone. 00:04:59So these  or a crush. 00:04:54And so now that growth plate is gone. 00:04:59So these Salter-Harris physio fractures, so these account for 15 to 20% of all pediatric fractures and treatment is based on an accurate diagnosis. 00:05:10And that diagnosis is critical because in addition to healing, the goal is to avoid disrupting subsequent growth. 00:05:18So the Salter-Harris classification is used to identify the different varieties of epiphyseal fractures. 00:05:25And so again, number one is S and that's a straight across type I and 5% of fractures are type I. 00:05:35The type two is the above and 75% of all fractures are the above type, 75%. 00:05:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:48Type III is L the lower and 10% of fractures are type III. 00:05:54So when we :48Type III is L the lower and 10% of fractures are type III. 00:05:54So when we think about type III, we're thinking about below that green line, below that growth plate. 00:06:02And then type IV is 2 or 3 or transverse. 00:06:05And again, 10% of these fractures are type 4, and 5 is where that growth plate is completely crushed. 00:06:11And that's a fairly uncommon fracture occurring in 5% or less. 00:06:16Generally, the higher the classification the greater the risk of complications and the worse the prognosis is for the patient. 00:06:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:31So in this image, again, we're looking at features of fractures of the epiphysis and epiphyseal plate. 00:06:38And so here we're looking at this distal tibia and we have hyseal plate. 00:06:38And so here we're looking at this distal tibia and we have a Salter-Harris type II fracture. 00:06:45And the fracture extends through the growth plate and exits through the metaphysis. 00:06:51And this creates this triangular wedge of metaphysis that's displaced with the epiphysis. 00:06:56And so we can see. 00:06:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:00All the way down and over, and you can see this. 00:07:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:08Wedge. 00:07:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:12Okay? 00:07:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:23So, in the pediatric population, the healing of fractures is divided into 3 phases, the inflammatory or acute phase, the repar , in the pediatric population, the healing of fractures is divided into 3 phases, the inflammatory or acute phase, the reparative or the subacute phase, and finally, the remodeling or chronic phase. 00:07:37And remodeling is much more extensive in an adult population. 00:07:42And children's fractures don't always remodel with great results. 00:07:45Again, it depends on the type of fracture and how that growth plate is impacted. 00:07:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:53So that remodeling capacity is really dependent on three basic factors the skeletal age of the child the distance of the fracture site and the growth plate and then the severity of displacement of the fragments. 00:08:08[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | whatâ€™s in your video? | cielo24.com 5.4 Fracture Reduction00:00:01Okay, so welcome to Lecture 5.4, and this lecture will cover fracture reduction, open and closed fracture, external and internal. 00:00:12Not fraction, fracture, external and internal. 00:00:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:18So the objectives for Lecture 5.4 are to describe the differences between open reduction and closed reduction of a fracture, and describe the differences between internal and external fixation of a fracture. 00:00:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:38Reduction and fixation of fractures. 00:00:41Reduction is the restoration of displaced bone fragments to their normal anatomic position, and this occurs either through closed or open reduction. 00:00:51Closed reduction, no incisions are made and manipulation, traction, or both are used to guide the fragments into place. 00:01:00In open reduction  made and manipulation, traction, or both are used to guide the fragments into place. 00:01:00In open reduction, an incision is made to expose the fracture site, and after reduction the fracture fragments are kept in position through fixation. 00:01:10[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:12So during closed reductions of fractures, again, no surgical incisions are made, rather the fragments are physically guided back into position through manipulation, traction, or a combination of manipulation and traction. 00:01:27In most fractures a soft tissue pin will be present between the bone ends. 00:01:32Open reduction of fractures surgically expose the fracture site. 00:01:37Fixation is the method of maintaining fracture fragments in position after reduction in order to achieve healing. 00:01:44All fractures benefit from fixation immediately to provide pain relief, and over time to promote healing. 00:01:52[BLANK_AUDIO]  than two millimeters in width. 00:08:37[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:44Surgically compressed bone healing. 00:08:47So fracture healing on compressed and surgically fixated bone occurs via direct osteoblastic activity with little or no periosteal reaction or callus formation. 00:08:58Immediate remodeling occurs as bone deposition and resorption continuous simultaneously as a result of osteoblastic and osteoclastic cell activity. 00:09:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:16So here we're looking at three images of a fracture to a 17-year-old girl. 00:09:21In image A, the fracture fragments are displaced laterally, and so we're looking here at the tibia. 00:09:28You see that displacement in the fibula, and you see that displacement. 00:09:34And B, we're seeing the formation of  in the fibula, and you see that displacement. 00:09:34And B, we're seeing the formation of callus, you can see these lumps forming there, callus formation. 00:09:43And then in C, no evidence of fracture lines remain, but we do see, 00:09:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:51A residual callus formation. 00:09:54So successful healing of both fractures is what we're looking at here with these three images. 00:10:00In image A, these are emergency room films made after a sledding accident. 00:10:06And so the fracture is located at the junction of the distal and middle thirds of the shafts of the tibia and fibula. 00:10:14In both bones, the fracture fragments are overriding and displaced laterally, good alignment exists. 00:10:21In image B, 00:10:22  are overriding and displaced laterally, good alignment exists. 00:10:21In image B, 00:10:22[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:24These are follow-up films taken three weeks later. 00:10:28And the image is taken through the plaster cast and it shows formation of callus bridging the fracture gap. 00:10:35So this patient did have external fixation, she had the plaster cast. 00:10:40And C, these are follow-up films taken one year later, and they show good progression of remodeling and no evidence of the fracture lines. 00:10:49[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | whatâ€™s in your video? | cielo24.com  immediately to provide pain relief, and over time to promote healing. 00:01:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:55Fixation of fractures. 00:01:57An external fixation would include a plaster cast or a splint. 00:02:02An internal fixation includes pins, wires, plates, screws, rods, other kinds of hardware. 00:02:10ORIF stands for open reduction internal fixation. 00:02:15So an external fixation is with a plaster cast, immobilization, or a splint is used to maintain a closed reduction. 00:02:22And open reduction uses an internal fixation, which employs orthopedic hardware or appliances such as pins, wires, plates, screws. 00:02:32And a combination of both open reduction and internal fixation is often referred to by that abbreviation, ORIF. 00:02:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:47So fixation, and , ORIF. 00:02:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:47So fixation, and here we have three types of fixation displayed on three different patients. 00:02:54In A, and we have a plaster cast on that side. 00:02:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:02And this plaster cast is immobilizing a distal radius fracture, and you can see the fracture with the arrow right here. 00:03:10In B, we have internal fixation, and this is plate and hardware used for wrist arthrodesis. 00:03:20And this is a fusion technique to relieve pain and provide stability in patients with advanced arthritis. 00:03:26In C, we have a combination of internal and external fixation, and this is a standard uniplanar external fixator used for the treatment of a comminuted distal radius fracture. 00:03:38So the pins  external fixator used for the treatment of a comminuted distal radius fracture. 00:03:38So the pins are anchored into the second metacarpal and the radial shaft. 00:03:44The ulnar styloid fracture is also present. 00:03:49And you see that here, that ulnar styloid fracture, we can see this, what a mess, huh? 00:03:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:09So here we have an image of a fixation, an open reduction internal fixation of the right radius. 00:04:16And this person fell from a ladder of a height of only 80 centimeters, and they came in with right elbow pain and obviously there was a fracture. 00:04:27And an ORIF was performed one day after the initial presentation. 00:04:31And so we see that fracture, dislocation of the right radius there. 00:04:35[BL 04:31And so we see that fracture, dislocation of the right radius there. 00:04:35[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:39And the ORIF, 00:04:41[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:44Carried out one day after his initial trauma. 00:04:47[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:53So fracture healing. 00:04:55We have cortical bone healing, cancellous bone healing, and surgically compressed and fixated bone healing. 00:05:02So cortical bone fractures heal by the formation of new bone, or callus, bridging a fractured gap. 00:05:09Cancellous bone fractures unite with little or no callus formation. 00:05:14Healing occurs via direct osteoblastic activity at the fracture site, also referred to as creeping substitution. 00:05:22Surgically compressed and fixated bone  at the fracture site, also referred to as creeping substitution. 00:05:22Surgically compressed and fixated bone heals via direct osteoblastic activity with little or no periosteal reaction or callus formation. 00:05:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:39Cortical bone healing. 00:05:40Fracture healing in cortical bone, as we see an A, a hematoma fills in the fracture site after the periosteum and the endosteum rupture. 00:05:51So we have this fracture going all the way through here and the hematoma filling it up. 00:06:00And the periosteal and endosteal response results in bone deposition that proceeds toward the fracture. 00:06:08So that's what we're seeing right here, this bone deposition, and creeping in that way. 00:06:13[BLANK_AUDIO]  right here, this bone deposition, and creeping in that way. 00:06:13[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:16And in C, you can see that a collar of callus surrounds the fracture site, and this will progressively remodel over time. 00:06:26The primary callus is eventually replaced by a secondary callus. 00:06:31And this callus becomes organized in response to mechanical stresses on the bone. 00:06:36Recall the lecture earlier on Wolff's law, right, bone is going to remodel based due to the demands that are placed on it 00:06:43[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:50And this image is an example of cancellous bone healing. 00:06:54And this is inter-trabecular bone formation seven days after a drill hole is placed in the proximal tibia of the mouse. 00:07:02So we can  days after a drill hole is placed in the proximal tibia of the mouse. 00:07:02So we can imagine a drill hole right through this area, and this is seven days afterwards. 00:07:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:15And so we can already see some of that new bone formation. 00:07:19So cancellous bone injuries occur in vertebral compression fractures, and distal radius fractures, tibial condyle fractures, etc. 00:07:30Cancellous bone fractures unite with little or no callus formation, and instead they heal by membranous bone formation. 00:07:37Intra-trabecular bone formation occurs quickly, and healing occurs via direct osteoblastic activity at the fracture site, also referred to as creeping substitution. 00:07:50This method of healing requires that the fracture fragments be in close contact with each other. 00:07:55If :50This method of healing requires that the fracture fragments be in close contact with each other. 00:07:55If approximation cannot be achieved, the hematoma fills in the gap and the healing proceeds by callus formation. 00:08:03Cancellous bone formation is spatially restricted. 00:08:07It does not extend to more than a few millimeters outside of the injured region. 00:08:11The filling of a defective cancellous bone of a few millimeters width can therefore be slow or even incomplete. 00:08:19This is quite different from shaft fracture healing, which can fill up considerable gaps. 00:08:24So if the gap in cancellous bone during instrumented fixation or joint replacement surgery is more than a few millimeters, healing can be slow or incomplete, and rarely if it's greater than two millimeters in width. 00:08:37[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:44S 5.5 Fracture HealingEffects00:00:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:02Okay, so welcome to lecture 5.5, Fracture Healing, Missed Fractures, and Professional Communication. 00:00:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:13So, the objectives for 5.5 are to identify factors which influence the timeframe for fracture healing. 00:00:22Identify three causes of commonly missed fractures and describe the importance of professional collaboration, and communication with regards to patient outcomes. 00:00:31[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:35So we'll begin with the overlapping phases of fractured healing and the timeframe for complete fracture healing is divisable into three phases that overlap a little bit. 00:00:47The inflammation phase occupies around 10% of the total healing time, the reparative phase occupies around 40% and the remodeling phase takes up about 70% of the total  healing time, the reparative phase occupies around 40% and the remodeling phase takes up about 70% of the total healing time. 00:01:00So the vast majority of fracture healing time is dedicated to remodeling. 00:01:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:09So the timeframe for fracture healing is generally 4-8 weeks. 00:01:14The actual time and the process of healing is influenced by a number of factors, so we can take, for example, the distal radius, 00:01:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:32And the median healing time is around 5.6 weeks, so the recommended length of immobilization is around six weeks. 00:01:41On the other hand, take a look here at the scaphoid, the median healing time in weeks is around 7.7 weeks but the recommended length of a mobilization for the scaphoid is between 6 and  00:08:58Complications in fracture healing, there are a number of complications that can interrupt fracture healing or impact fracture healing. 00:09:06And here are some of the complications that can be related to fracture healing, threatening condition such as hemorrhage, or tetanus, complications and associated tissues such as compartment syndrome or infection. 00:09:21Complications of bone at a fracture site such as nonunion, or malunion, or pseudarthrosis ,as we mentioned earlier, and then late-effect complications, such as complex regional pain syndrome. 00:09:35[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:45So continuing with complications in fracture healing, delayed union is present in any situation where a fracture fails to unite in a timeframe usually required for union. 00:09:57Although fracture healing is delayed, the process of cellular repair is present, and this will continue on to complete union, provided that the adverse factors that are delaying the union are  cellular repair is present, and this will continue on to complete union, provided that the adverse factors that are delaying the union are removed, and no additional stresses are imposed. 00:10:11Causes of delayed union may be disrupted vascularity, infection, inadequate or interrupted immobilization, unsatisfactory reduction, severe local trauma, loss of bone substance, or wide distraction of fragments. 00:10:28Slow union may occur in many fractures, even when conditions are ideal. 00:10:33Even though the rate may be slow, this may be an average rate for the given conditions, such as age or fracture site, and is therefore not pathological. 00:10:43Nonunion is failure of fracture fragments to unite and the repair process is ceased. 00:10:49The factors contributing to delayed union if left unchecked will cause nonunion. 00:10:54[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:04So in this slide, we're looking at a 10:54[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:04So in this slide, we're looking at a scaphoid fracture. 00:11:07In image A ,we can see the fracture site there. 00:11:12And in image B, we can still see the fracture site, there's no indication of fracture healing, that fracture is still present despite the hardware. 00:11:23And in image C, you see six weeks later, there are still nonunion of the scaphoid, and you can still see this gap [UNKNOWN] here. 00:11:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:41So the fracture is, in this case, occurring through the waist of the scaphoid. 00:11:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:51In A, the arrows mark the fracture site. 00:11:53In B right here, the fracture was internally fix In A, the arrows mark the fracture site. 00:11:53In B right here, the fracture was internally fixated with three pins. 00:11:59And so the the film made in B was two months after the surgery. 00:12:04And as I mentioned earlier, it shows no indication of fracture healing. 00:12:08That radiolucent line represents the fracture site and it's unchanged from image A. 00:12:14And so the hardware or the pins were subsequently removed. 00:12:17In image C, this follow-up film was made six weeks after the hardware removal. 00:12:23And again, as I mentioned earlier, it shows a nonunion of the scaphoid 00:12:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:33Complications in fracture healing can include malunion, where the fracture is united, but an angular or a rotational deformity exists. 00:  healing can include malunion, where the fracture is united, but an angular or a rotational deformity exists. 00:12:42Recall that slide from earlier with the angulator radius. 00:12:47Pseudoarthrosis is another complication, the creation of a false joint when the ends of the bones in a nonunion become surrounded by a bursal sac. 00:12:57Osteomyelitis, a pathogen is spread from an open fracture or a surgical fixation. 00:13:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:11Pseudarthrosis or false joint is an abnormal condition at a nonunion fracture site, where a bursal sac surrounds the fracture site, and as depicted here. 00:13:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:30And this is an image of avascular necrosis where a blood supply to a bone is compromised, which then leads to bone death.  is an image of avascular necrosis where a blood supply to a bone is compromised, which then leads to bone death. 00:13:40And in this image, this is avascular necrosis of the lunate in a 25-year-old man. 00:13:45The increased density of the lunate represents the body's attempt to revascularize and produce new bone. 00:13:53And so you can see this, it's lit up and much brighter. 00:13:56[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:00So C is capitate, L is lunate, the S is the scaphoid, and Tq is triquetrum. 00:14:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:11So complications in fracture healing occurring in other tissues. 00:14:16Heterotopic ossification, where we have formation of bone in muscle and soft tissue. 00:14: 16Heterotopic ossification, where we have formation of bone in muscle and soft tissue. 00:14:21Myositis ossificans, when skeletal muscle is involved, and fasciitis ossificans, when fascia is involved. 00:14:29Arterial injury, fractures and dislocations can result in vascular injury. 00:14:34Nerve injury, usually temporary neuropraxia occurs from a nerve stretch, but serious nerve injuries usually are associated with open fractures. 00:14:44So heterotropic ossification can occur at any age, but typically affects young adults with a clear history of local trauma or surgery. 00:14:53The formation of heterotopic ossification after orthopedic trauma has been studied most extensively in the setting of fractures of the acetabulum and fractures of the elbow. 00:15:03There's also a high incidence of heterotopic ossification after  and fractures of the elbow. 00:15:03There's also a high incidence of heterotopic ossification after hip arthroplasty, hip replacement, traumatic amputations, traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury, and severe burns. 00:15:17Arterial injuries are associated with a small percentage of fractures. 00:15:21Fortunately, most nerve injuries associated with fractures and dislocations are temporary, and they generally result, as I mentioned earlier, from stretching of the nerve, and these resolve spontaneously over time. 00:15:34Many patients experience temporary paresthesia as a result of soft tissue edema. 00:15:39This is also benign and self-limited. 00:15:41More serious nerve injuries are associated with open fractures and penetrating injuries. 00:15:47Fractures near the elbow and knee are most often involved, as are dislocations of the hip, knee, and shoulder. 00:15  elbow and knee are most often involved, as are dislocations of the hip, knee, and shoulder. 00:15:54Open exploration and nerve repair are often necessary in such cases. 00:15:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:16:02Suspected arterial injury in primary care Generally, we would assess distal circulation in all patients with suspected fracture or dislocation. 00:16:12We would assess circulation as soon as possible. 00:16:15When dislocation or fracture is accompanied by the absence of pulse and orthopedic care is not available, then we would attempt reduction. 00:16:25So one article in particular advises primary care providers to minimize adverse outcomes of arterial injuries by following these parameters. 00:16:35Assess distal circulation in all patients with a fracture or dislocation. 00:16:39Slow pulse, pallor, and slow capillary refill, which is defined as more than three seconds  00:16:39Slow pulse, pallor, and slow capillary refill, which is defined as more than three seconds, are signs of arterial injury. 00:16:48Assess circulation as soon as possible before radiographic examination. 00:16:53When dislocations and fractures are accompanied by the absence of pulse, and orthopedic care is not readily available, primary care providers should attempt reduction. 00:17:03In many cases, the artery is kinked rather than torn. 00:17:06If the limb is pulseless, much is to be gained and little lost by attempting reduction. 00:17:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:17:15Compartment syndrome. 00:17:16Increased pressure within a closed space compromises circulation and tissue function, and this can result in ischemic necrosis. 00:17:25So the signs of compartment syndrome are the 5 P's, pain, pallor,  time in weeks is around 7.7 weeks but the recommended length of a mobilization for the scaphoid is between 6 and 12 weeks. 00:01:54So quite a bit of variability and I think that's probably what I'd like you to take away from this slide. 00:02:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:05So we'll cover 12 factors that influence fracture healing, the first is the age of the patient, number two is the degree of local trauma, and the degree of bone loss and the type of bone involved. 00:02:19So, generally, the younger a patient, the more rapidly the fracture will heal. 00:02:24The greater local trauma at the fracture site and an adjacent soft tissue results in delays to fracture healing. 00:02:32More tissues involved in the injury diffuse the cellular repair effort, delaying healing and greater displacement of the fracture fragments are also known to delay fracture healing. 00:02  necrosis. 00:17:25So the signs of compartment syndrome are the 5 P's, pain, pallor, paresthesia, paralysis, and pulselessness. 00:17:33But these are not always present. 00:17:36A compartment syndrome is a condition in which the circulation and the function of the tissues within a closed space are compromised again by increased pressure within that space. 00:17:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:17:49The pain is generally deep and poorly localized. 00:17:53The pallor is distal to the compartment. 00:17:56And the paraesthesia is usually of a sensory nerve passing through the compartment. 00:18:01Paralysis, permanent damage's likely without treatment. 00:18:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:18:14Life-threatening conditions include hemorrhage, and this is the most common life-threatening condition associated with a fracture. :14Life-threatening conditions include hemorrhage, and this is the most common life-threatening condition associated with a fracture. 00:18:21Fat embolism is usually associated with multiple fractures, motor vehicle accident, crushing injury, and fat from the bone marrow enters the veins, eventually lodging an artery in the lungs. 00:18:33Pulmonary embolism is usually related to immobilization and decreased activity associated with fracture healing, which increases the risk of venous thrombosis. 00:18:44A minority of fractures have life-threatening consequences. 00:18:47The key to the management of these conditions is early recognition and proper treatment. 00:18:53Regarding hemorrhage, half of all pelvic fractures require a transfusion. 00:18:59Closed femoral fractures can also result in severe hemorrhage. 00:19:03A fat embolism in a single fracture is rare, but when it does occur, it is  00:19:03A fat embolism in a single fracture is rare, but when it does occur, it is usually associated with long bone fractures in young adults, or hip fractures in the elderly. 00:19:14Crushing type fractures allow fat from the bone marrow to enter the veins in the form of globules, which eventually lodge in one of the arteries of the lung. 00:19:23Fat embolisms generally develops 12 hours after a fracture, but can appear up to 72 hours after a fracture. 00:19:31Symptoms are similar to those with pulmonary embolism in the early stages. 00:19:35Clinical signs include a fever, hypoxia, confusion, restlessness, changing neurological signs, urinary incontinence, and a particular rash across the chest and in conjunctiva. 00:19:48The classic signs of pulmonary embolism are sudden onset of dyspnea and anxiety with or without substernal pain :48The classic signs of pulmonary embolism are sudden onset of dyspnea and anxiety with or without substernal pain. 00:19:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:20:00Additional life-threatening conditions. 00:20:03Gas gangrene is usually associated with a deep-penetrating injury and contamination with Clostridium. 00:20:09Gas is produced from the fermentation of muscle sugars and spreads along the muscle. 00:20:14Tetanus is usually associated with an open fracture, and it's contaminated with Clostridium tetani. 00:20:21Infection stays in the wound, producing toxin that passes along nerves to the spinal cord. 00:20:27Gas gangrene after a fracture is almost always associated with a deep penetrating injury to muscle. 00:20:34The Clostridium group of organisms responsible for this condition is found in the intestinal tracts of humans and animals. 00 34The Clostridium group of organisms responsible for this condition is found in the intestinal tracts of humans and animals. 00:20:40The risk of contamination was always present because these organisms are found everywhere, from barnyards to hospital operating rooms. 00:20:50Initial symptoms are pain, edema, and exudate of thin dark fluid. 00:20:55The fluid and bubbles of foul smelling gas produced from the fermentation of the muscle sugars, spread along the muscle sheaths, separating the sheath from the muscle. 00:21:05It can be physically pressed up and down the length of the muscle. 00:21:08The fluid is highly toxic, and the condition can rapidly progress to toxemia and death. 00:21:14In tetanus, open fractures can also be contaminated by Clostridium tetani. 00:21:21And this is commonly found in soil. 00:21:24The resulting infection stays localized in the  00:21:21And this is commonly found in soil. 00:21:24The resulting infection stays localized in the wound, and in this respect, is the opposite of the infection causing gas gangrene. 00:21:32However, it produces toxins that are more virulent than the deadliest snake venom. 00:21:37Within seven to ten days, the toxin gradually passes along nerves from the wound to the spinal cord, anchoring onto the motor neurons. 00:21:45Stimulation of the motor nerves causes rigidity and convulsions. 00:21:48The jaw muscles are involved earliest, hence the name lock jaw. 00:21:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:21:57So we'll talk a little bit now about commonly missed fractures. 00:22:00And these are usually linked to failure to order radiography, failure to recognize fractures on radiograph. 00:22:08Subtle fractures that may not  failure to order radiography, failure to recognize fractures on radiograph. 00:22:08Subtle fractures that may not be evident on initial radiograph, or presence of multiple injuries, or inadequate patient histories. 00:22:16Fractures are not usually missed by patients. 00:22:19Acute pain is pretty reliable. 00:22:21Fractures are missed by clinicians, and studies indicate these errors are usually linked to one of the following factors. 00:22:28And those are the ones that we mentioned above. 00:22:30[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:22:34So the importance of history and physical examination, and commonly missed fractures. 00:22:39Patient history. 00:22:40What's their trauma? 00:22:41What was the mechanism of injury? 00:22:44And the physical examination is their tenderness to palpation, the clinical prediction rules in the American College  00:22:44And the physical examination is their tenderness to palpation, the clinical prediction rules in the American College of Radiology Criteria. 00:22:52Communication, communicating information from your patient examination to the radiologist may be crucial to helping the radiologist interpret the image without overlooking or missing important findings. 00:23:05So, trauma usually precipitates a fracture, but sometimes the onset is insidious or unknown, such as stress fractures or bone stress injuries, and runners for osteoporosis. 00:23:17During the physical exam, acute point tenderness to palpation over the fracture site is both a reliable perception of the patient and a reliable clinical sign of a fracture. 00:23:28Clinical decision rules are well substantiated lists of clinical patient factors that have a strong predictive value in determining whether a patient has a fracture or not. 00:23:39The application of clinical decision rules helps to ensure that injuries requiring definition by radi  a fracture or not. 00:23:39The application of clinical decision rules helps to ensure that injuries requiring definition by radiography do get image, and helps to prevent unnecessary imaging for injuries for which outcome is unaffected by imaging. 00:23:53So essentially, we're trying to limit imaging in cases where it's not necessary, and make sure we have imaging performed in those cases where it's very likely to be meaningful. 00:24:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:24:07The rule of treatment in fracture management. 00:24:10If suspicion for fracture is high and imaging is negative, treat it as a fracture, immobilize it, and re-evaluate with imaging in one to two weeks. 00:24:18Always err on the side of caution. 00:24:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:24:25So if a fracture is present, it will announce itself on the follow up radiograph by localized density  00:24:25So if a fracture is present, it will announce itself on the follow up radiograph by localized density changes of effective site. 00:24:34And if a fracture's not present, the patient has only suffered a minor inconvenience. 00:24:38The good sense of this fracture management principle avoids the detrimental possibilities of an unstabilized fracture, and the reality of malpractice actions. 00:24:47Errors on the side of caution rarely have adverse outcomes. 00:24:51[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | whatâ€™s in your video? | cielo24.com  the cellular repair effort, delaying healing and greater displacement of the fracture fragments are also known to delay fracture healing. 00:02:43The loss of bone, substance, or excessive distraction of the fragments compromises the ability of the cells to bridge that gap at the fracture site, and that also can contribute to a delay in healing. 00:02:55Cancellous bone unites rapidly, but only at points of direct contact between the bone. 00:03:01Cortical bone unites by two mechanisms depending on the local conditions. 00:03:06A rigid, immobilized site with contact of fragments will heal faster than a poorly immobilized site with displacement 00:03:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:20The next four factors that influence healing include degree of immobilization, infection, local malignancy and nonmalignant local pathological conditions. 00:03:32So inadequate immobilization leads to delayed union or even to nonunion of malignant local pathological conditions. 00:03:32So inadequate immobilization leads to delayed union or even to nonunion of the bones. 00:03:38If movement persists during the repair process, a cleft or false joint, of a pseudarthrosis, can develop between the fragment ends of the bone. 00:03:48Infection at a fracture site results in delayed or complete lack of healing because the local cell response is focused on containing or eliminating the infection, instead of healing the bone. 00:04:01Unless a malignancy is treated, fractures through a primary or secondary malignant tumor will not demonstrate meaningful healing. 00:04:10Fractures through a nonmalignant but abnormal bone may heal but in some instances such as Paget's disease or fibrous dysplasia healing may be delayed or may not even happen at all. 00:04:21[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:27The last four factors we  at all. 00:04:21[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:27The last four factors we're going to discuss which influence healing include radiation necrosis, avascular necrosis, hormones and exercise and local stress about the fracture. 00:04:40Bone exposed to radiation heals more slowly and may fail to unite because of cell death, vessel thrombosis and fibrosis of marrow. 00:04:49Usually bone healing occurs from both ends of the fracture site, but if one fragment is avascular, then healing must proceed from one side only, and this can delay the process. 00:05:01If both sides have vascular disruption, then the chances of healing are very low. 00:05:07Corticosteroids are powerful inhibitors of the rate of fracture healing, and growth hormones stimulate fracture healing. 00:05:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:16Forces acting on the fracture site stimulate bone :05:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:16Forces acting on the fracture site stimulate bone healing, but while appropriate stress to the fracture site can be beneficial unwanted motion at the fracture site can result in delayed union or even malunion. 00:05:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:35This is an image of a radial malunited fracture and ulnar fracture non-union. 00:05:41So this is an old distal owner and radio fracture in this video of graph of a 15 year old male. 00:05:48Let's see evidence of a fractured gap and bone resorption at the distal ulnar, answer here. 00:05:55[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:04And there's no callus formation. 00:06:06You also see this medially angulated malunited distal radius fracture, so you see this fracture it's malunited [ You also see this medially angulated malunited distal radius fracture, so you see this fracture it's malunited [INAUDIBLE] Again the two things to take away from this are this fractured gap here and there's evidence of bone resorption here. 00:06:31You can see how this is sort of diffuse and then the final thing to take away is this medial angulation. 00:06:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:43This is a malunited fracture mid-shaft of the right humerus with outward bowing, and you can also see osteoarthritis of the glenohumeral joint. 00:06:55So this is a 55 year old female with right arm swelling, she has a history of right arm trauma and its been ongoing for six months after a fall in the bathroom and she was treated at another hospital. 00:07:09The patient indicated that she refused surgery, and therefore  the bathroom and she was treated at another hospital. 00:07:09The patient indicated that she refused surgery, and therefore the fracture was treated conservatively with an arm sling. 00:07:17This resulted in malalignment of the humerus and healing occurred in this malunited fashion. 00:07:22Malunited fractures cause mechanical changes that can lead to osteoarthritis in nearby joints. 00:07:29And so what I'd like you to see here in this image is if we look at the glenohumeral joint, you can see the lack of space, and we can also see this sclerotic change here. 00:07:42Of course, the obvious presence here is this malunion 00:07:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:00So if radiologic examination during fracture healing. 00:08:03The frequency of examination depends on the stability of the fracture and the need to monitor any complications  healing. 00:08:03The frequency of examination depends on the stability of the fracture and the need to monitor any complications. 00:08:12The least amount of radiographic monitoring is appropriate in a non-displaced, uncomplicated closed fracture immobilized in a cast. 00:08:21In this case, the patient would have initial radiographs to diagnose and direct treatment, and then no further radiographs until the cast is removed approximately six weeks later. 00:08:33And these images would be to document evidence of successful healing. 00:08:38Displaced fractures may be radiographed frequently. 00:08:41Also fractures that demonstrate potential alignment problems or fractures that are at risk for other complication may be imaged more frequently, even at one or two week intervals. 00:08:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:58Complications in fracture healing, there are a number of complications that can interrupt fracture healing or impact fracture
