1.1 Symptom InvestigationEffects00:00:00[MUSIC] 00:00:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:10Hi and welcome to lecture 1.1 symptom investigation. 00:00:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:24The objectives here for lecture 1.1 are to, let's see here, 00:00:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:35Summarize why a body diagram may provide useful information, describe the use of open and closed-ended questions as a component of symptom investigation. 00:00:47Describe how knowledge of potential pain location patterns associated with viscera, can be beneficial and how it can also be confounding. 00:00:56And finally, identify three questions you might ask a patient regarding the onset of their symptoms and describe the appropriate time frame over which to assess changes in their symptoms. 00:01:09[BL  of their symptoms and describe the appropriate time frame over which to assess changes in their symptoms. 00:01:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:13Symptoms investigation. 00:01:16So we use a body diagram for noting the exact location of symptoms and descriptors of the symptoms. 00:01:23For example, aching or burning or shooting pains, as well as peristysia, numbness, and weakness. 00:01:30We try to use open-ended questions to avoid leading or biasing the conversations. 00:01:35So examples might include things like, how are you feeling today? 00:01:38What brings you in today? 00:01:39What seems to be bothering you the most today? 00:01:42Those are examples of open-ended questions. 00:01:45The answer could prompt you to ask, are you more sore today than usual or does your pain move around :01:45The answer could prompt you to ask, are you more sore today than usual or does your pain move around or does your pain increase or decrease in intensity? 00:01:54The authors of your Boston Notebook recommend asking do you have symptoms anywhere else? 00:02:00I'm generally more cautious about this, I may return to this question eventually, but to avoid confusion or over complication, initially the focus is on the patient's chief complaint at least in my experience. 00:02:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:23Symptom investigation, follow up questions. 00:02:26So ask follow up questions to help rule out potential diagnoses, noting other complaints or symptoms could be useful here. 00:02:35As you become experience, screen at least one joint or body region above, and one joint or body region below the patient's area of chief complaint. 00:02:46So the patient with low back  one joint or body region below the patient's area of chief complaint. 00:02:46So the patient with low back pain states my back hurts. 00:02:49A follow-up question may be have you experienced any numbness or tingling in either leg. 00:02:54Any progressive loss of strength? 00:02:56Any increasing frequency of tripping, or have you experienced a fall recently? 00:03:02Asking the patient about any other complaints like nausea, fever, abdominal pain, upper back, or shoulder pain could be useful for suggesting follow-up questions or screening to rule out serious pathology. 00:03:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:17Overlapping pain patterns, and one of the important things that you'll see frequently here in these presentations is to see a specific table and this one is table 5.1 in your book. 00:03:30Your book also includes a number of  table and this one is table 5.1 in your book. 00:03:30Your book also includes a number of boxes and figures and I'll refer to those quite often. 00:03:38It just seems to be the the format of the book and that's how the author put it together. 00:03:43Lots of tables, lots of figures, lots of boxes. 00:03:48So there's considerable overlap between pain referred from musculoskeletal structures and pain associated with visceral disorders. 00:03:57Certain pain descriptions may be unusual for musculoskeletal pain. 00:04:02So vascular disorders could present with a patient complaining of throbbing or pounding or pulsating kinds of symptoms. 00:04:09Neurologic disorder could present with symptoms that a patient might describe as sharp or shocking or burning. 00:04:18And visceral disorders could present with symptoms such as aching, squeezing, gnawing  or burning. 00:04:18And visceral disorders could present with symptoms such as aching, squeezing, gnawing, burning or cramping. 00:04:26The symptom descriptions alone don't really contain enough information to diagnose or base any kind of referral. 00:04:32Knowledge of potential pain location patterns associated with viscera can guide the PT and selecting the organ systems to screen further with questions related to a review of symptoms. 00:04:44Symptom onset, so information about when the symptoms began should be obtained. 00:04:51And is this the episode that started everything? 00:04:55Is there a multi year history? 00:04:57Can the patient point to a specific inciting event? 00:05:00So many patients cannot relate the onset of their symptoms to any particular incident or accident. 00:05:07However, if you question them carefully, you can often uncover a likely cause, such as  accident. 00:05:07However, if you question them carefully, you can often uncover a likely cause, such as the patient beginning to run after not having run for three months, or being promoted to some kind of position that requires sitting at a desk for eight hours a day. 00:05:21Or starting to return to gardening, or yard work after the winter. 00:05:26If the onset of symptoms is truly insidious, if new symptoms occur during the course of treatment, or if resolved symptoms return for no apparent mechanical reason, then you should begin having some questions about the underlying nature of the condition. 00:05:44[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:47Behavior and pattern of symptoms. 00:05:49So has the intensity of the symptoms changed over time? 00:05:54Are symptoms affected by activity versus rest, or by the patient's position, or the time of day? 00:06:01Is the  by activity versus rest, or by the patient's position, or the time of day? 00:06:01Is the behavior of the symptoms generally predictable over a 24-hour period? 00:06:06So for many patients with neuromusculoskeletal disorders, a description of how symptoms do or do not change over a 24-hour period is adequate. 00:06:20For patients with disorders such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, or head injury, the appropriate time frame may be three to six months for symptoms to change. 00:06:31If the symptom pattern reveals no consistency, then you should begin questioning whether physical therapist intervention is warranted. 00:06:40The inconsistent symptom pattern combined with location of symptoms should alert you to screen specific body symptoms later in the examination. 00:06:49However, if for example, the patient's thoracic pain increases after eating, you may begin to consider whether GI pathology is present. 00:07:  patient's thoracic pain increases after eating, you may begin to consider whether GI pathology is present. 00:07:01So here's an example of a sequence of questions you may ask your patient. 00:07:05Which of your symptoms is interfering most with your normal function? 00:07:10Can you explain why these symptoms may have begun? 00:07:13Describe the symptoms, do the symptoms spread to any other body, regions or parts? 00:07:19Please rate the intensity of your symptoms on a 0 to10 scale. 00:07:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:24Was there a recent injury or any flare-up of your symptoms? 00:07:29Is your pain constant or does it come and go? 00:07:33What things tend to make your pain worse or better? 00:07:36Does your pain wake you up at night? 00:07:39Have you  worse or better? 00:07:36Does your pain wake you up at night? 00:07:39Have you had any previous episodes with similar symptoms? 00:07:42Do you have symptoms anywhere else, and if the answer is yes, repeat the appropriate previous questions. 00:07:49[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | whatâ€™s in your video? | cielo24.com 1.2  The Low Back and Lower Extremities; Regional Pain Patterns and Associated Disorders00:00:01Lecture 1.2, regional pain patterns and associated diseases and disorders, low back and lower extremities. 00:00:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:12So the objectives here are to identify 4 forms you might give to a patient with low back pain to provide additional information about that patient's condition. 00:00:23Describe at least two non-musculoskeletal causes of low back pain and under what circumstances you might reevaluate a musculoskeletal cause of labaquine. 00:00:34Describe symptoms which might lead you to include cauda equina in your list of differential diagnoses. 00:00:42Identify five potentially serious conditions which may mimic less serious musculoskeletal conditions in the pelvis, hip, and thigh. 00:00:52And finally, identify  musculoskeletal conditions in the pelvis, hip, and thigh. 00:00:52And finally, identify five potentially serious conditions which may mimic less serious musculoskeletal conditions in the knee, lower leg, ankle, and foot. 00:01:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:06Low back pain questionnaires and forms. 00:01:09So some of these forms include the modified oswestry low back pain disability questionnaire. 00:01:15Usually you'll see that abbreviated and this is an outcome measure. 00:01:18Another one is the Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire. 00:01:21Again, this is usually abbreviated FABQ. 00:01:26Common Medical History Intake Forms, and then finally a Red Flag Screening Form could be included, and we'll learn more about these as the class progresses. 00:01:36So a patient with low back pain presenting  this condition results in paresthesias, and potentially in paralysis. 00:07:59The vascular compromise accompanying this condition results in diminished peripheral pulses and, potentially, a change in skin color. 00:08:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:14Finally, septic arthritis and cellulitis continuing in the knee, lower leg, ankle, and foot. 00:08:19Septic arthritis is an inflammation in a joint caused by a bacterial infection. 00:08:24Cellulitis is an infection in the skin after a wound becomes contaminated by bacteria. 00:08:30Patients who have septic arthritis complain of a constant aching or throbbing pain and a swelling in a joint. 00:08:37The involved joint is usually tender and warm when palpated. 00:08:40And depending on which joint is involved, erythema may be present. 00:08:44Patients who develop septic arthritis often  joint is involved, erythema may be present. 00:08:44Patients who develop septic arthritis often are immunosuppressed or have pre-existing systemic joint disease. 00:08:54An infection in the tissues, cellulitis, exhibits the classic signs of pain, skin swelling, warmth. 00:09:01And advancing irregular margin of erythema or reddish streaks, suspicion of either septic arthritis or cellulitis would warrant an immediate referral of the patient to a physician. 00:09:15[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | whatâ€™s in your video? | cielo24.com  and we'll learn more about these as the class progresses. 00:01:36So a patient with low back pain presenting to your clinic may be given multiple forms to fill out to try and obtain as much useful information about the case as possible. 00:01:48Low back pain, cause of pain. 00:01:51If a patient is over 55 and is failing to improve, it may be appropriate to consider non musculoskeletal causes of the low back pain. 00:02:00Or, it may be appropriate to inquire about an infection as the cause of the patient's low back pain. 00:02:07If the patient notes that their comfort does not change in any position, the likelihood that the pain is not musculoskeletal in origin increases. 00:02:17So asking the patient about a history of trauma, osteoporosis, or other disorder that may decrease bone density may help you rule out spinal fracture as a cause of , osteoporosis, or other disorder that may decrease bone density may help you rule out spinal fracture as a cause of the patient's pain. 00:02:30So a physical therapist asks the 55 year old patient the following questions to increase or decrease, there's suspicion that this patient's low back pain is caused by cancer. 00:02:42Do you have a history of cancer? 00:02:44If so, what type of cancer? 00:02:47Have you recently lost weight, even though you have not been attempting to eat less or exercise more? 00:02:52If you have, how much weight have you lost? 00:02:55When asking about infection, questions such as, have you recently had a fever? 00:03:00Or have you recently taken antibiotics for an infection or have you been diagnosed with an immunosuppressive disorder can all provide you with useful information. 00:03:09[BLANK_AUD  with an immunosuppressive disorder can all provide you with useful information. 00:03:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:14Cauda equina, to rule out cauda equina, asking about changes in bowel or bladder habits as well as saddle paresthesia and lower extremity weakness can be useful. 00:03:26A positive response to any of these questions increases the suspicion that the patient has cauda equina syndrome. 00:03:33You can follow these inquiries with a physical examination assessing sensory integrity of the perianal and perineal areas, as well as the L4, 5, and S1 dermatomes. 00:03:45You can also assess motor integrity of L4, the quadriceps and tibialis anterior or L5 and S1 musculature. 00:03:54[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:59Pelvis, hip and thigh.  00:03:54[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:59Pelvis, hip and thigh. 00:04:02Colon cancer, femoral neck fracture, osteonecrosis, Legg-Calve-Perthes, and slipped capital femoral epiphysis can all mimic common musculoskeletal disorders of the pelvis, hip and thigh. 00:04:17In older populations, proximal femur fractures become increasingly likely. 00:04:22Patient demographics, age, sex, etc, and a detailed health history are important. 00:04:28Medications affecting bone density are also important screening components. 00:04:33Leg calf perthes is most common in 5-8 year old boys and they often report groin, thigh and knee pain that worsens with weight bearing activities. 00:04:43Slip capital femoral epiphysis occurs in adolescents and 2-1 in boys vs girls.  00:04:43Slip capital femoral epiphysis occurs in adolescents and 2-1 in boys vs girls. 00:04:51Symptoms include groin, thigh or knee pain and limited hip internal rotation range of motion. 00:04:58Pathologic fractures of the femoral neck occur secondary to disease and often in the absence of major trauma. 00:05:05These fractures are most common in individuals over 50 years, women more often than men, and patients who have a history of metabolic bone disease, such as osteoporosis or Paget's disease. 00:05:18A history of a fall from a standing position is often reported, along with a feeling of a sudden painful snap in the hip region and giving way. 00:05:26Acute groin pain is usually reported. 00:05:30In Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, this condition results from an idiopathic loss of blood supply From the lateral -Calve-Perthes disease, this condition results from an idiopathic loss of blood supply From the lateral ascending cervical artery to the femoral head. 00:05:40Patients with osteonecrosis and Legg-Calve-Perthes disease often report pain in the groin, thigh, and knee that worsens with weight-bearing activities resulting in an antalgic gait. 00:05:52Common clinical findings in children with Legg-Calve-Perthes disease also include shortening of the involved leg. 00:05:59Unlimited internal rotation and abduction of the involved hip. 00:06:02[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:06Knee, lower leg, ankle and foot and deep vein thrombosis. 00:06:13Compartment syndrome deep vein thrombosis, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, septic arthritis, and cellulitis, are all serious conditions  thrombosis, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, septic arthritis, and cellulitis, are all serious conditions to consider in this region, in this region being the knee, lower leg ankle and foot. 00:06:30Peripheral vascular disease often includes aching and buttock thigh and calf that increases with activity and improves with rest. 00:06:39A DVT may manifest as calf pain that increases with activity, but half of DVT patients do not experience calf pain. 00:06:48Risk factors for DVT include recent surgery, malignancy, trauma, prolonged immobilization and pregnancy. 00:06:57Peripheral vascular disease. 00:06:59Usually can be sussed out by looking at pedal pulses and whether they're decreased and also looking for wounds and sores on the toes or feet of patients. 00:07:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:12Continuing with knee,  of patients. 00:07:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:12Continuing with knee, lower leg, ankle, and foot, compartment syndrome. 00:07:16Compartment syndrome is a result of swelling inside a connective tissue compartment. 00:07:21Usually it's a result of trauma or a rapid increase in physical activity. 00:07:26Symptoms of compartment syndrome include pain when a stretch is applied to the involved muscle. 00:07:32Keep in mind the six Ps of compartment syndrome, pain, palpable tenderness, paraesthesia, paresis, pallor, and pulselessness. 00:07:42So, with compartment syndrome the physical examination typically reveals swelling, tenderness and palpable tension of the involved compartment. 00:07:52The nerve entrapment or compression found in this condition results in paresthesias, and potentially in paralysis. 00:07:59The vascular compromise accompanying this condition 1.3  The Thoracic and Trunk Regions; Regional Pain Patterns and Associated Disorders00:00:02Hi there, so continuing with Lecture 1.3 on regional pain patterns and associated disorders, we'll now be focusing on the thoracic and trunk region. 00:00:14So the objectives for this lecture include identify four general non-musculoskeletal conditions. 00:00:22Changing the color here, which may produce thoracic trunk pain. 00:00:26Define angina, describe at least three risk factors and describe the difference between stable and unstable angina. 00:00:34Provide a general definition of each of the following, pericarditis, pulmonary embolus, pleurisy, and cholecystitis. 00:00:43Identify symptoms of non-duodenal ulcers which may be associated with malignancy. 00:00:49Describe symptoms which may duodenal ulcers which may be associated with malignancy. 00:00:49Describe symptoms which may be associated with pyelonephritis and kidney stones. 00:00:55Thoracic pain, cardiac and pulmonary disorders. 00:00:59Cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and urogenital conditions may recreate pain in this region. 00:01:07Myocardial infarction may feature angina, left arm pain, epigastric, midthoracic spine pain, right shoulder pain, neck, jaw, or tooth pain. 00:01:201 in 3 patients, however, may not experience chest pain. 00:01:25Dyspnea, nausea, palpitations, or syncope may be the only symptoms patients present with. 00:01:33Risk factors include, a history of diabetes, age, being female, nonwhite, a history of congestive heart failure or a history of , a history of diabetes, age, being female, nonwhite, a history of congestive heart failure or a history of stroke. 00:01:45Unstable angina is chest pain that occurs outside of a predictable pattern and does not respond to nitroglycerin. 00:01:53Individuals experiencing unstable angina must be closely monitored. 00:01:57Signs suggesting myocardial infarction such as subternal squeezing or crushing pressure, pain radiating into both arms, shortness of breath, pallor, diaphoresis. 00:02:08Or angina lasting more than thirty minutes, should alert the therapist that immediate transportation of the patient to an emergency department or coronary care facility is indicated. 00:02:21Thoracic pain continued, pericarditis is an inflammation of the pericardium and symptoms may include left shoulder and arm pain. 00:02:29And a pulmonary embolus and blood clot is involved  symptoms may include left shoulder and arm pain. 00:02:29And a pulmonary embolus and blood clot is involved in this can produce substernal shoulder or upper abdominal pain. 00:02:38Pleurisy and pneumothorax are 2 other conditions that may cause chest pain. 00:02:44With pericarditis, inflammation prevents complete expansion of the heart, resulting in less blood leaving the heart, to make up for the reduced stroke volume and to get enough oxygen to the tissues, the heart beats faster. 00:02:58If increased heart rate cannot compensate enough, the individual may start to breathe heavily and the veins in the neck may distend and blood pressure may decrease drastically during inhalation. 00:03:09This condition is termed cardiac tamponade, and should be considered a medical emergency. 00:03:16In addition to chest pain, patients with pulmonary embolus may develop dyspnea, wheezing and a marked 16In addition to chest pain, patients with pulmonary embolus may develop dyspnea, wheezing and a marked decrease in blood pressure. 00:03:24Factors that increase the risk for blood clots in the lower extremities or pelvis, and subsequent embolus include immobilization or recent surgery. 00:03:33Two patient types that therapists frequently treat, patients who've had recent surgery or been immobilized. 00:03:41Pulmonary embolism also has a high mortality rate, so if the physical therapist suspects this condition, the patient should immediately be referred to emergency care. 00:03:51Pleurisy is an irritation of the pleural membranes that make up the lining between the lungs and the inner surface of the rib cage. 00:03:59The pain that pleurisy produces is characteristically described as sharp and stabbing, and the pain is worsened by deep inspiration and other ribcage movements such as cough, istically described as sharp and stabbing, and the pain is worsened by deep inspiration and other ribcage movements such as cough, bending, and reaching activities. 00:04:14Thoracic pain, gastrointestinal disorders, gastric or peptic ulcers are common disorders that may cause thoracic pain. 00:04:23Gastric ulcers outside of the duodenum may be associated with malignancy. 00:04:28Symptoms may include black, tarry stools, red clumps and vomit, changes in pain with eating, or pain in the chest or back. 00:04:36Cholecystitis is an inflammation of the gall bladder, and may cause pain in the right upper abdomen, interscapular or right scapular region. 00:04:46Duodenal ulcers manifests as dull nine or burning pain in the epigastric region, in the mid thoracic region, or in the supr  nine or burning pain in the epigastric region, in the mid thoracic region, or in the supraclavicular region. 00:04:56These symptoms occur when the stomach is empty, and are relieved with eating or taking antacids. 00:05:02Relief is temporary, however, and the symptoms return within two to three hours. 00:05:07If the ulcer is located in the stomach, which is a gastric ulcer, eating may increase rather than relieve the symptoms. 00:05:15With regards to cholecystitis, patients initially may present to therapy with shoulder or mid back pain. 00:05:21But suspicion of this condition should result in immediate referral to their physician. 00:05:25[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:28Kidney disorders, pyelonephritis and renal stones may cause pain in the posterior thoracic and lumbar region. 00 , pyelonephritis and renal stones may cause pain in the posterior thoracic and lumbar region. 00:05:36Often accompanied by chills, fever, nausea, vomiting and renal colic. 00:05:41Pyelonephritis is a kidney infection, and kidney stones are hard salt precipitates from urine. 00:05:49Renal colic is excruciating intermittent pain from the costovertebral angle or flank that spreads across the lower abdomen. 00:05:58[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | whatâ€™s in

Disorders: Shoulder and Craniofacial Symptoms. 00:00:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:16So, the objectives for this lecture are to identify four serious underlying conditions which may produce cervical or shoulder discomfort. 00:00:26Identify three serious underlying conditions which may be responsible for craniofacial pain. 00:00:32Describe at least two symptoms associated with meningitis and subarachnoid hemorrhage. 00:00:39Identify three items from a patient's history that may increase the likelihood of a brain tumor as a source of craniofacial pain. 00:00:48Central cord syndromes, ligamentous instability, brachial plexus neuropathies, and Pancoast Central cord syndromes, ligamentous instability, brachial plexus neuropathies, and Pancoast's tumor may be responsible for shoulder and or cervical pain. 00:00:59Special tests for cervical instability have a high likelihood of bias and questionable diagnostic accuracy. 00:01:05Before performing any of these tests, utilize the Canadian C-Spine rules. 00:01:11Tingling, weakness, numbness, or burning in more than one extremity, clonus or Babinski's signs may suggest spinal cord pathology. 00:01:21Brachial plexus neuropathies may affect sensory, motor, or mixed nerves. 00:01:27The therapist should conduct a thorough examination of motor and sensory function, and reflexes in the area of interest. 00:01:34Pancoast's tumor is a malignant tumor in the lung, most often occurring in men over age 50 who have a history of smoking 's tumor is a malignant tumor in the lung, most often occurring in men over age 50 who have a history of smoking. 00:01:42In 90% of patients, shoulder pain appears before pulmonary symptoms. 00:01:48Regarding neuropathic pain, you should carefully observe the area, preferably with the area disrobed to allow for bilateral comparison of muscle bulk and to note possible atrophy. 00:02:01If you suspect a specific nerve, you should consider the muscles and sensory distribution that would be affected. 00:02:08Pancoast's tumor, initially, patients with Pancoast's tumor typically have nagging pain in the shoulder and along the vertebral border of the scapula as the tumor irritates the parietal pleura. 00:02:20As the tumor continues to invade the thoracic inlet, the pain becomes burning in nature, extending down the arm and into the ulnar nerve distribution. 00:02:29 , the pain becomes burning in nature, extending down the arm and into the ulnar nerve distribution. 00:02:29Over time, the intrinsic hand muscles atrophy and the tumor occludes the subclavian vein. 00:02:36Occlusion causes venous distension of the ipsilateral arm. 00:02:41Because of the slow progression, the disorder is undetected or misdiagnosed for an average of up to 6.8 months. 00:02:50Craniofacial pain. 00:02:52Meningitis, brain tumor, or a subarachnoid hemorrhage may be a cause of head, face, or jaw pain. 00:03:00Meningitis is more common in individuals with compromised immune systems, children under two years old, and individuals living in close quarters. 00:03:09The slump test to detect meningitis has a positive likelihood ratio of 0.97. 00:  00:03:09The slump test to detect meningitis has a positive likelihood ratio of 0.97. 00:03:15So, this is not a great test for detecting meningitis. 00:03:21A history of breast, or lung cancer, or melanoma may increase the likelihood of brain tumor as a source of pain. 00:03:28Subarachnoid hemorrhage may result in headache, meningeal irritation, fever, photophobia, nausea, vomiting, or neurologic dysfunction. 00:03:40So regarding meningitis, an unexplained and progressive fever in children under the age of two, should warrant an immediate physician consult. 00:03:50Patients may demonstrate difficulty actively or passively flexing the neck and inability to touch the chin to the chest. 00:03:57Although your text suggests using the slump test to screen for meningitis, use of it to diagnose meningitis was developed in the pre-  using the slump test to screen for meningitis, use of it to diagnose meningitis was developed in the pre-antibiotic era and in patients with severe late-stage, untreated bacterial and tuberculosis meningitis. 00:04:13A recent study involving 297 adults with suspected meningitis revealed the positive likelihood ratio of 0.97, as I mentioned above. 00:04:23And it did not accurately discriminate between patients with and without meningitis. 00:04:29The test demonstrated diagnostic value in only four patients who had severe meningeal inflammation. 00:04:36Instead, a headache that worsens after horizontally rotating the head at a frequency of two to three times per second may be more sensitive with a sensitivity up to 0.97. 00:04:50Regarding brain tumors, although a headache is a symptom associated with a brain tumor, neurologic deficits are a more common symptom in the early and middle stages of this disorder. 00:  with a brain tumor, neurologic deficits are a more common symptom in the early and middle stages of this disorder. 00:05:01A change in mentation, vomiting with or without nausea, visual changes, seizures, ataxia and speech impairment are all possible presentations with or without headaches. 00:05:14Symptoms of this type would warrant a detailed neurologic screening. 00:05:18[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | whatâ€™s in your video? | cielo24.com 1.5 The Elbow, Wrist, and Hand Pain; Regional Pain Patterns and Associated Disorders 00:00:01Hi, welcome back, and welcome to lecture 1.5, Regional Pain Patterns and Associated Disorders, Elbow, Wrist, and Hand Pain. 00:00:10[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:13So our objectives for this section are to identify 3 factors which may increase, change the pen color here, susceptibility to more serious elbow, wrist, and hand injuries. 00:00:27Summarize Grade I, Grade II, and Grade III soft tissue injuries. 00:00:31Describe 4 factors which may raise suspicion of an infection in a patient's hand. 00:00:37Summarize important components of an examination of the upper extremity for infection, including 4 specific factors, the presence of which are associated with most major hand infections. 00:00:51Describe Raynaud's disease/phen  presence of which are associated with most major hand infections. 00:00:51Describe Raynaud's disease/phenomenon, including 3 questions you may ask your patient in an effort to increase or decrease the likelihood of this diagnosis. 00:01:01Define complex regional pain syndrome and symptoms, which if present, may increase the likelihood of CRPS contributing to the patient's condition. 00:01:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:15Elbow, wrist, and hand pain. 00:01:17Tauma-related injuries to the elbow, wrist, or hand should raise suspicion of serious injury. 00:01:24Osteoporosis, history of corticosteroid use, or a history of immunosuppression may all increase susceptibility to a more serious injury. 00:01:36Fractures of the elbow, wrist, and hand. 00:01:39An elbow fracture is likely after a fall onto [BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:51So this is a flowchart of diagnosis of Raynaud's, and it starts with asking, has a typical episode of Raynaud's phenomenon been witnessed by a clinician or shown to the clinician in photographs or a video? 00:08:04A typical episode of Raynaud is characterized by the following. 00:08:07A sudden onset of cold fingers or toes, an association with sharply demarcated color changes of skin color, followed by cyanotic skin, so a white attack followed by a blue attack. 00:08:19With re-warming ischemic phase, wider blue attack usually last 15 to 20 minutes. 00:08:26The skin subsequently blushes and turns red or pink upon recovery. 00:08:31So, if this has occurred, you want to evaluate for possible secondary causes of Raynaud's phenomenon. 00:08:39If it has not occurred  you want to evaluate for possible secondary causes of Raynaud's phenomenon. 00:08:39If it has not occurred, then you want to ask the patient the following questions, and those are what we mentioned above. 00:08:45Are your fingers unusually sensitive to cold? 00:08:48Do your fingers change color when exposed to cold? 00:08:50If your fingers change color, do they turn white, blue, or both? 00:08:56So fingers are unusually sensitive to cold, but not associated with color changes, that's unlikely Raynaud's phenomenon. 00:09:02If fingers change color when exposed to cold, that's possible Raynaud's phenomenon, if the changes are uniphasic. 00:09:11If the fingers change color when exposed to cold and the changes are biphasic, then we can presume it's Raynaud's, and we evaluate for secondary causes of Raynaud's. ic, then we can presume it's Raynaud's, and we evaluate for secondary causes of Raynaud's. 00:09:22So it's a very complex flowchart, 00:09:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:26I don't expect you to memorize all this. 00:09:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:30So this is a picture of a typical episode of Raynaud's. 00:09:34And on the left, we see that pallor in several fingers. 00:09:38And on the right, we see the cyanosis at the fingertips 00:09:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:50Complex regional pain syndrome, CRPS. 00:09:53CRPS is a disorder, usually affecting the distal limbs and is characterized by pain, swelling, limited motion, vasomotor instability, skin changes, and patch  the distal limbs and is characterized by pain, swelling, limited motion, vasomotor instability, skin changes, and patchy bone demineralization. 00:10:08The onset is often after a fracture or surgery. 00:10:10The pathogenesis is unknown. 00:10:13Pain is the most prominent and debilitating symptoms. 00:10:15[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:18There are often other symptoms, and various types of sensory abnormalities are common in CRPS. 00:10:23About two-thirds of patients with CRPS have functional motor impairments related to pain. 00:10:29Impairment is typically manifested by a reduction of complex muscle strength and hand grip, or during standing on your toes. 00:10:37Limb movement may be limited by edema, pain, or contractures. 00:10:41Some patients develop central motor manifestations such as tremor, myoclonus , or contractures. 00:10:41Some patients develop central motor manifestations such as tremor, myoclonus, dystonic postures, or impaired initiation of movement. 00:10:52Autonomic changes can also occur, and that includes differences in skin temperature, skin color, sweat, or edema, these are common. 00:11:01Skin changes can affect the connective tissue in CRPS. 00:11:05And those may include increased hair growth, increased or decreased nail growth, contraction and fibrosis of joints and fascia, as well as skin atrophy. 00:11:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:20So we would consider CRPS if the following symptoms are present. 00:11:25Number 1, pain, sensory changes, motor symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, or trophic changes, which develop after limb trauma, usually within four to six weeks. 00:11:37Number 2  trophic changes, which develop after limb trauma, usually within four to six weeks. 00:11:37Number 2, the symptoms are no longer fully explained by the initial trauma. 00:11:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:43And number 3, the symptoms affect the distal limb, they go beyond the region involved in the trauma, or they extend beyond the territory innervated by a single nerve or nerve root. 00:11:54There is a more elaborate set of criteria compared to the three above, which includes possible imaging, and the clinical diagnostic criteria are comprised of the Budapest consensus criteria. 00:12:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:10CRPS and patient history. 00:12:13Is the patient history consistent with a neurological or musculoskeletal issue that may respond to physical therapy treatment? 00:12:20Does it make sense to you or does it seem off? 00  may respond to physical therapy treatment? 00:12:20Does it make sense to you or does it seem off? 00:12:24Given the patient history, have you decided whether other body systems or body regions, upper or lower quadrant, should be screened in addition? 00:12:33The location of symptoms may alert you to warning signs for serious disorders. 00:12:38Specific medical screening questionnaires and questions related to patient history will help you collect valuable information. 00:12:46[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | whatâ€™s in your video? | cielo24.com ractures of the elbow, wrist, and hand. 00:01:39An elbow fracture is likely after a fall onto an outstretched hand or after direct trauma to the elbow. 00:01:46Other common fractures include a distal radius fracture, scaphoid fracture, lunate, or capitate fractures. 00:01:53In an elbow fracture, elbow extension is the function most impaired, and there may be a palpable gap between the olecranon and the trochlear notch of the humerus. 00:02:04A fall also may cause anterolateral pain and tenderness, with an inability to supinate and pronate the forearm. 00:02:11Often the arm will be held against the trunk with the elbow flexed, with the patient demonstrating an inability to fully extend the elbow. 00:02:21In a distal radius fracture, known as a Colles fracture, this typically manifests with local pain. 00: :21In a distal radius fracture, known as a Colles fracture, this typically manifests with local pain. 00:02:27Distal radius tenderness, swelling, and ecchymosis, and wrist extension in particular is very painful. 00:02:35After a scaphoid fracture, the patient has similar signs and symptoms, but these are localized to the anatomic snuff box. 00:02:43The wrist can also be very stiff, secondary to the swelling. 00:02:45In a lunate or capitate fracture, the lunate fractures are rare and often are related to osteonecrosis while a capitate fracture is more common. 00:02:58Patients present with symptoms similar to those of wrist pain, swelling, and tenderness at the mid-dorsal wrist area. 00:03:06Capitate fractures are the result of trauma involving maximal wrist flexion or extension, however, instead of osteonecrosis 06Capitate fractures are the result of trauma involving maximal wrist flexion or extension, however, instead of osteonecrosis. 00:03:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:20Soft tissue injuries of the elbow, wrist, and hand. 00:03:24Grade I muscle strain stretches the tissue without disruption. 00:03:29Grade II is a partial tearing of the muscle tissue while sparing the overlying fascia. 00:03:35Grade III is a complete tear of the muscle and fascia resulting in a total loss of motion. 00:03:40[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:44Infection of the elbow, wrist, and hand. 00:03:47Puncture wounds, abrasions, cuts, or other causes of skin disruption increase the likelihood of infection. 00:03:55Fever, chills, a new onset of hand pain, or drainage should all raise your suspicion of an 03:55Fever, chills, a new onset of hand pain, or drainage should all raise your suspicion of an infection. 00:04:03A patient's occupation may increase exposure to certain infectious agents. 00:04:09So occupation such as an animal handler, even someone gardening, washing dishes, or working in a tropical fish store. 00:04:17Immune status affects morbidity from hand infections. 00:04:21So diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or malignancy, all affect morbidity. 00:04:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:29You want to take patient vital signs and expose the entire upper extremity for examination if you suspect an infection. 00:04:36Epitrochlear and axillary lymphadenopathy often accompany a forearm infection. 00:04:41[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:43We mentioned above, occupation, the patient's occupation may increase their [BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:43We mentioned above, occupation, the patient's occupation may increase their exposure to certain infectious agents. 00:04:51An animal handler may be prone to bite wounds that may become infected with organisms typical for involved species. 00:04:57A rose gardener, for example, is at risk for infection through the introduction of spores through a cut or puncture wound in the skin. 00:05:05Certain professions are more prone to chronic paronychia. 00:05:09As an example, dishwashers are likely to develop candida infections, whereas a person employed in a tropical fish aquarium is more likely to develop another kind of infection after a hand injury, mycobacterium. 00:05:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:29And here are two images of infection. 00:05:32On the left is erythema following a catfish sting and  are two images of infection. 00:05:32On the left is erythema following a catfish sting and a subsequent infection. 00:05:37And we can see here the redness, the area of erythema. 00:05:42And this right here is the puncture wound from the catfish sting. 00:05:46So on the right, this photograph demonstrates a dorsal subcutaneous abscess. 00:05:52Note that the abscess is pointing, meaning that the skin is starting to thin from the pressure of the fluid underneath it. 00:05:59And this indicates an impending rupture of the abscess. 00:06:03So, I can see this, 00:06:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:07Whole area, and this is the pointing of the abscess. 00:06:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:18So this  pointing of the abscess. 00:06:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:18So this is another image of infection in the elbow, wrist, and hand. 00:06:25And this is an example of skin necrosis with MRSA infection. 00:06:29[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:38Infection, diagnosing most hand infections. 00:06:41The majority of hand infections can be diagnosed on clinical examination based on the presence of pain, erythema, abnormal swelling, or drainage. 00:06:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:55Raynaud's disease or Raynaud's phenomenon. 00:06:58This is an exaggerated vascular response to cold or emotional stress. 00:07:03Note color changes of the skin and fingers. 00:07:07Raynaud's can be secondary to systemic lupus erythemat  skin and fingers. 00:07:07Raynaud's can be secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis. 00:07:13It's more common among young females and in families with a history of Raynaud's. 00:07:18[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:23Raynaud's diagnostic criteria, there are no simple tests or diagnostic criteria that can be used to diagnose Raynaud's. 00:07:30The following questions, however, may be helpful. 00:07:33Asking your patient, are your fingers unusually sensitive to cold? 00:07:38Do your fingers change color when exposed to cold? 00:07:42If the fingers change color, do they turn white, blue/purple, or both? 00:07:47[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:51So this is a flowchart of diagnosis of Raynaud's
