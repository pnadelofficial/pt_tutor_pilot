8.1 Musculoskeletal Ultrasound: What is it?Effects00:00:00[MUSIC] 00:00:09So welcome to week eight, and the first lecture is on musculoskeletal ultrasound. 00:00:14So we're going to start with musculoskeletal ultrasound. 00:00:17What is musculoskeletal ultrasound? 00:00:21[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:24So our objectives are to describe how energy is converted to sound waves and how those sound waves are transformed into an image in the process of ultrasound imaging. 00:00:35Then we're going to identify the common equipment and functionality of the equipment used in ultrasound imaging. 00:00:41We'll discuss the difference in equipment shape and image between linear and curvilinear transducers, and describe how frequency affects ultrasound image resolution. 00:00:51[BLANK_AUDIO inear transducers, and describe how frequency affects ultrasound image resolution. 00:00:51[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:55Ultrasound imaging. 00:00:57In ultrasound imaging, images are created from sound waves which are reflective of tissues and the interfaces between tissues. 00:01:05The origins of ultrasound imaging are in sonar. 00:01:09And sonar stands for sound navigation and ranging, which was prevalent on submarines during World War II. 00:01:16Medical use of ultrasound began around the 1940s and 1950s with its ability to detect lumps in breast tissue. 00:01:25The diagnostic ultrasound uses the difference between the emitted and the received sound wave to allow the generation of images. 00:01:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:35So these are some examples of diagnostic ultrasound equipment. 00:01:38And ultrasound equipment is packaged in a variety of forms from  these are some examples of diagnostic ultrasound equipment. 00:01:38And ultrasound equipment is packaged in a variety of forms from laptops, to tablets, to handheld units, as you see over here on the far right. 00:01:50And the equipment cost can run from $5,000, upward of $100,000 depending on the scope of the things that it can do and the quality of images it can produce. 00:02:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:04So the ultrasound transducer, the images created by a linear transducer are rectangular over here. 00:02:14And the field of view has the same diameter as the transducer. 00:02:17All right, so here's the diameter of the transducer, here's the diameter of the field. 00:02:23The curvilinear transducer, so this is curved, those images are angled, and the beam diver :23The curvilinear transducer, so this is curved, those images are angled, and the beam diverges, which results in a field of view that is wider than the transducer. 00:02:35So if we compare, again, here's the diameter of the linear transducer. 00:02:41Here's the diameter of the curvilinear transducer, but the diameter of this image is wider. 00:02:50So the transducer sends a ultrasound pulse into the tissues and then receives echoes back. 00:02:57And those echoes contain spatial and contrast and intensity information. 00:03:03The transducer head can be arranged in either a linear or a curvilinear shape. 00:03:09Musculoskeletal ultrasound uses a linear array, while pelvic, abdominal, and deep structures such as the hip are usually better imaged with a transducer which is curvil  pelvic, abdominal, and deep structures such as the hip are usually better imaged with a transducer which is curvilinear. 00:03:21So again, that linear array transducer on the left displays a longitudinal view of the anterior hip with a field of view that's narrow and is the same as the transducer itself. 00:03:34While the curved array transducer on the right, the view widens as the distance from the transducer increases, showing not just the head of the femur, is right here, but also the neck and the proximal shaft of the femur. 00:03:52So this produces an image of the hip where the deeper structures appear larger than the superficial structures as a result of that divergence. 00:04:02So this slide shows some diagnostic ultrasound transducer heads. 00:04:06And transducer heads come in different shapes and sizes and are filled with different technology that  heads. 00:04:06And transducer heads come in different shapes and sizes and are filled with different technology that allows each head to perform various functions. 00:04:14One head may operate at a range of frequencies that's completely different from another, allowing more clarity at greater or more superficial depths. 00:04:23A smaller head could allow imaging of smaller structures. 00:04:26For example, you could use it on toes or the fingers, although a larger head permits imaging of more area. 00:04:33A convex head will provide an image that looks different than a head that is straight. 00:04:38The other thing to keep in mind with ultrasound is that the frequencies result in different depths of imaging. 00:04:48And high frequencies will be better for superficial structures, while low frequencies will be better for imaging deeper structures. 00:04:55[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:59So the  better for imaging deeper structures. 00:04:55[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:59So the ultrasound includes a pulsar and a transducer, and the pulsar produces electrical energy in waves with different frequencies. 00:05:09And those frequencies are usually in the range of 2 to 15 megahertz, and that's referred to as the base frequency. 00:05:17And so the pulsar delivers bursts of waves at this base frequency to the ultrasound transducer. 00:05:22And between these bursts, there's nothing, but silence. 00:05:25And the sound waves are emitted for about 1% of the examination time. 00:05:29The transducer acts as a receiver for the reflected sound waves 99% of the time. 00:05:35And so the transducer converts that electrical energy to sound energy. 00:05:41And then it delivers the ultrasound to the tissues, ducer converts that electrical energy to sound energy. 00:05:41And then it delivers the ultrasound to the tissues, and it receives the reflected sound energy. 00:05:47And it converts that reflected sound energy back into electrical energy. 00:05:51[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:56So once that sound energy is converted back into electrical energy, the computer converts that electrical energy from the transducer to a digital one, and that's displayed as an image. 00:06:10The signal is amplified and noise is also reduced. 00:06:13Images are most often in grayscale, but Doppler imaging can actually use colors. 00:06:18[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | whatâ€™s in your video? | cielo24.com 8.2 How does Tissue Affect US Imaging00:00:01So welcome to lecture 8.2. 00:00:03How does tissue affect ultrasound? 00:00:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:10So our objectives are to define ultrasound attenuation, including reflection, refraction, absorption and scattering. 00:00:19Describe why ultrasonography is considered real-time imaging. 00:00:23Identify some of the advantages and disadvantages of ultrasound versus MRI. 00:00:29And define rehabilitative ultrasound imaging, RUSI. 00:00:33[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:36So the interaction between ultrasound and tissues. 00:00:40Some of the energy emitted by the transducer gets reflected back and some is absorbed by tissues and converted to heat energy. 00:00:48Now, diagnostic ultrasound does not produce enough energy to cause a measurable rise in tissue temperature  heat energy. 00:00:48Now, diagnostic ultrasound does not produce enough energy to cause a measurable rise in tissue temperature. 00:00:55The energy emitted by the transducer is attenuated or offset through reflection, refraction, absorption and scattering. 00:01:05So, this is a simplified image of ultrasound attenuation. 00:01:09And we can see here that some of the energy that is emitted by the transducer, which is here is absorbed, some is reflected. 00:01:20Some of that energy is then scattered, and some is refracted. 00:01:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:25So absorption is responsible for most of the attenuation of ultrasound. 00:01:29And absorption is the result of intermolecular friction which converts mechanical energy of ultrasound to waves of heat. 00:01:40So similar to looking at an object underneath the water waves transmitted across an :08:12We can examine intraosseus abnormalities. 00:08:16We can look at deep structures. 00:08:18And this is much less operator dependent. 00:08:21And this is an image of a healthy Achilles tendon and calcaneus, so we can see how the tendon attaches here to the calcaneus 00:08:29[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:34And everything is intact, right? 00:08:36[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:40So here we're looking again at two long axis views pasted together, and we're looking at pre and post Achilles repair. 00:08:51And so again in the pre, you can see these sort of gaps down here are interruptions, that integrity of the fiber. 00:09:04And as you can see, you see this little image right here that tells us where we're imaging and the patients but so And as you can see, you see this little image right here that tells us where we're imaging and the patients but so here's the calcaneus, this bright bony area. 00:09:16And we can see when we looked at the post-op images here that the tendon shows much more continuity. 00:09:25And we can also see these areas where it's bunched together now because of the repair that we saw up here on top. 00:09:42You see the integrity is disrupted in multiple places. 00:09:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:49And this view down here is called a panoramic view because it glues together multiple longitudinal views to create one large continuous image, right. 00:09:59So again here's our calcaneus and now we can see here that post-op, this Achilles tendon is much more continuous versus. 00:10:16[BLANK_AUD  here that post-op, this Achilles tendon is much more continuous versus. 00:10:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:26And this is two months postoperatively. 00:10:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:33And these images are also taken two months post-op and this bottom image is from a curvilinear transducer. 00:10:39And so again if we visualize the transducer, right, we can have something. 00:10:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:47That's as this diameter, but because the transducer is convex, you get a much wider image. 00:10:58The other things to notice here are these hypoechoic regions, so these brighter regions right here. 00:11:04Those are sutures, which are bunching up. 00:11:09Jerry's keeping them all 11:04Those are sutures, which are bunching up. 00:11:09Jerry's keeping them all held together. 00:11:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:23Ultrasound and rehabilitation, rehabilitative ultrasound imaging or RUSI. 00:11:28So RUSI is a procedure used by physical therapists to evaluate muscle and soft tissue during exercise and activities. 00:11:37So it's used to assist during interventions aimed at improving neuromuscular function. 00:11:42So, for example, we can view the low back muscles during stabilization exercises, and examine motion and space in the shoulder girdle during shoulder exercises. 00:11:51[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | whatâ€™s in your video? | cielo24.com 24.com  ultrasound to waves of heat. 00:01:40So similar to looking at an object underneath the water waves transmitted across an interface undergo a change in direction. 00:01:49And that's refraction is the second one right here like light traveling from water to air. 00:01:56And then reflection and scattering, scattering occurs when the reflecting surface is uneven. 00:02:02Which causes less accurate localization of structures when we're doing ultrasound imaging and less signal energy. 00:02:10Ultrasound imaging is based on reflected sound traveling from structures back to the transducer head. 00:02:17So in the reflection scattering picture on the far right, one of the things to note here is that as this purple light comes down here and hits the structure. 00:02:27Let's get these very lightly colored, dashed lines and those represent the scattering. 00:02:38So why use diagnostic ultrasound? 00:02:41Di  dashed lines and those represent the scattering. 00:02:38So why use diagnostic ultrasound? 00:02:41Diagnostic musculoskeletal ultrasound equipment is usually portable, and sometimes it's in the form of a handheld unit as we noted before. 00:02:49And sometimes a tablet or a cell phone, and the setup and imaging is very quick compared to other imaging modalities like an MRI. 00:02:59So the quality of our special test isn't great. 00:03:01And in general, the information provided by most of our orthopedic special tests can be summarized by this. 00:03:07It is painful in this area. 00:03:10An image of a torn ligament or tendon, or an accumulation of fluid is information that can influence decision making quite a bit. 00:03:17Regardless of the pitfalls of over-imaging, patients we know from loads of published studies are likely to feel more :17Regardless of the pitfalls of over-imaging, patients we know from loads of published studies are likely to feel more satisfied with their care when they receive imaging. 00:03:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:31On the far side, that's what this study is showing. 00:03:35We look at patient value and perceptions of the overall value of an ultrasound image and sort of satisfaction. 00:03:44Most patients perceive ultrasound imaging or an image produced by an ultrasound scan as a very high value. 00:03:53So diagnostic ultrasound strengths include, you can use tenderness during palpation to guide the placement of the transducer. 00:04:02You can place the effective joint in a symptom provoking position. 00:04:06We can image while resisting motion or performing a stretch. 00:04:09You can image while testing ligament integrity, and we can image while applying traction or compression to an  00:04:09You can image while testing ligament integrity, and we can image while applying traction or compression to an area. 00:04:17So here's a clinical example of ultrasound and rehabilitation, and this patient presented with right shoulder pain, rated 6 out of 10, and manual muscle testing 3 out of 5. 00:04:31And on day one, musculoskeletal ultrasound was completed, and then the patient was imaged again after three months of physical therapy. 00:04:39And the imaging suggests a reduction of fluid and the patient reported a pain rating of 1 out of 10 and muscle testing improved to 4 out of 5 without reproduction of pain. 00:04:53So some of the things that we're looking at in this image are these images. 00:04:57Day one, this is the biceps tendon. 00:05:02This means that this is the glenohumeral joint right here. 00:05  tendon. 00:05:02This means that this is the glenohumeral joint right here. 00:05:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:08And the surrounding fluid would be this black area here. 00:05:12And then the right subscapularis tendon down here. 00:05:14And again, I think these images are meant to sort of point out this black area of this we call it hypoechoic or more fluid filled area. 00:05:29And then later on, so this was May 21st and on August 4th, we again see the biceps, tendon and less surrounding fluid. 00:05:39We see the right subscapularis tendon here. 00:05:43And again, less of that hypoechoic, that less visible area, that black sort of fluid filled area, and it's decreased in these images compared with the earlier ones. 00:05 , that black sort of fluid filled area, and it's decreased in these images compared with the earlier ones. 00:05:56[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:59So diagnostic ultrasound does have some limitations. 00:06:03The field of view is limited. 00:06:05There's a relatively small area that can be viewed on the screen when compared with an MRI, which can expose an entire joint or an entire region of the body. 00:06:15There's limited penetration of the field, so we're unable to penetrate bone. 00:06:20The depth of the penetration affects the resolution as well, and deeper structures are imaged at lower resolutions than more superficial structures. 00:06:29Finally, ultrasound imaging is very operator dependent. 00:06:33The value of the information gained from an ultrasound is dependent primarily on the skill and knowledge of the operator. 00:06:40The motor skills involved in manipulating the  ultrasound is dependent primarily on the skill and knowledge of the operator. 00:06:40The motor skills involved in manipulating the probe, combined with the knowledge of anatomy and multiple planes, are going to affect the value of the image interpretation. 00:06:51So some of the benefits of ultrasound include that it's less expensive, we can examine multiple joints to tend to have better patient tolerance. 00:07:00We can take more high resolution images as long as we're looking at more superficial structures. 00:07:05We can guide needle placement. 00:07:07And we can easily evaluate distal extremities such as the fingers or toes. 00:07:13On the right here, is an image and these are two long axis views pasted together. 00:07:19There's a complete full thickness tear of the Achilles tendon. 00:07:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:25And, what we notice here is . 00:07:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:25And, what we notice here is this dark area, this sort of fluid filled areas and dark area here too. 00:07:36And the dynamic scan here also showed an absent proximal tendon movement with the patient actively Dorsey and plantar flex to their foot. 00:07:46Compare that to this one, here's their calcaneus, you can see the things are not so intact. 00:07:55We can see a lot of this dark region. 00:08:01Now, what we'd like to do is compare that image from an ultrasound to an MRI. 00:08:05And an MRI we can see that we can examine an entire joint. 00:08:09We can assess intraarticular cartilage easily. 00:08:12We can examine intraosseus abnormalities. 00:08:16We can look at deep structures. 8.3 Transducer Orientation Affects What You See00:00:01So lecture 83, how transducer orientation affects what you see. 00:00:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:09Our goal for this lecture is to be able to describe how the orientation of the transducer affects the image specifically with regard to longitudinal versus transverse orientation. 00:00:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:23So, a diagnostic ultrasound, this is the longitudinal or long-axis view. 00:00:30And so, the long head of the biceps tendon with a longitudinal view, you can imagine that the, 00:00:37[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:40Transducer is going to be oriented this way. 00:00:45And so what we see here is the humerus, and then tendon, and then the deltoid muscle over the top  so what we see here is the humerus, and then tendon, and then the deltoid muscle over the top of it. 00:00:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:03And if we're looking down on the patient, this is the longitudinal view, here's the transducer, like that. 00:01:10[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:13So this is the long axis view. 00:01:16And these are illustrations showing, how to identify the long head of the biceps tendon in the longitudinal plane, and the patient has their arm facing anteriorly with the elbow flexed. 00:01:28And usually they're just asked to rest their hand on their lap at the palm of their hand facing upward. 00:01:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:35Okay, so the transducer head orientation right? 00:01:39Here right IO] 00:01:35Okay, so the transducer head orientation right? 00:01:39Here right, this reflects the fact that this is a longitudinal view of the biceps tendon because the transducer had long axis and is parallel to the biceps tendon. 00:01:51[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:54Okay, so here, this right here is a humorous. 00:01:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:02Okay, and so for a longitudinal view of the long head of the bicep tendon, the transducer is applied along the tendon, and the resulting image shows a sagittal slice of the tendon. 00:02:13And the top part of the transducer is usually represented along the left side of the image over here. 00:02:20And the right side of the image will reference the bottom part of the transducer and the longitudinal view. 02:20And the right side of the image will reference the bottom part of the transducer and the longitudinal view. 00:02:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:30Okay, so again we have the humerus, and we have the tendon right here. 00:02:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:38Then over the top here we have the deltoid muscle. 00:02:41[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:52So, for a transverse view of the same tendon, the transducer is applied across the tendon resulting in an axial image of the tendon. 00:03:01So we can see the orientation of the transverse view here and here. 00:03:11So now we're looking straight down on the tendon, 00:03:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:18And so here is the axis that I  00:03:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:18And so here is the axis that I'm on here. 00:03:21[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:24And so we're going to series of images that we're looking at here, number one, and here, and there's the rotator interval, right here is our humerus. 00:03:33We can begin to see the bicipital groove and number two in here represents this area is there. 00:03:44Now we can see much more of the bisects. 00:03:48The bicipital groove and the biceps tendon here, box and our biceps tendon. 00:03:54And then in number three, this is coming across right here. 00:03:59You can see the distal biceps groove right there, and the biceps tendon right there. 00:04:06And  can see the distal biceps groove right there, and the biceps tendon right there. 00:04:06And then finally in number four, you can now see the beginning of the biceps muscle belly, you can also see the pectoralis tendon, this white area here. 00:04:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:23And so we can see here, this is the transverse view, right? 00:04:27This patient's arm going down there, the view is running 00:04:31[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:33That way, right? 00:04:35As opposed to our longitudinal view before, there's more in this direction, okay. 00:04:44And so again in this view, this is our humorous. 00:04:47Here is our biceps tendon and then adulterated. 00:04:54[BLANK_AUDIO] 47Here is our biceps tendon and then adulterated. 00:04:54[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:02And here's a view of a normal gastroc and soleus. 00:05:05And on the left is a longitudinal view here, and on the right is a transverse view. 00:05:13[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:16And so, the small foot on the image has a little yellow line, and this line demonstrates the orientation of the ultrasound transducer head. 00:05:25That's the orientation, so, what that tells us is that this is a longitudinal view 00:05:31[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:34The orientation, so this is a transverse view. 00:05:37[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | whatâ€™s in your video? | cielo24.com AUDIO] cielo24 | whatâ€™s in your video? | cielo24.com 8.4 Echogenicity00:00:02Lecture 84, Echogenicity-Reflected Signal Amplitude. 00:00:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:10So the objectives for this lecture are to be able to define echogenicity and how it affects the ultrasound image, and identify which structures have the highest signal amplitude and which have low signal amplitude. 00:00:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:27So echogenicity refers to the degree to which tissues reflect sound waves. 00:00:33On the left we have a transverse image of the long head of the biceps tendon, actually, there it is. 00:00:41[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:47And the subscapularis tendon, which is here. 00:00:51[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:55And the bicipital groove  here. 00:00:51[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:55And the bicipital groove, which is right here, surrounding the biceps tendon on these sides. 00:01:04And then the transverse humeral ligament, which is over here. 00:01:09And the anterior deltoid, which is running over the top here. 00:01:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:18So a longitudinal image of the same area shows the tendon within the biceps groove, and so here we have the tendon, I'll kind of outline it here. 00:01:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:40Here we have humerus, and this is the biceps groove. 00:01:44So the important thing, I think, to take away here, 00:01:47[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:49Is given that And the soleus muscle, which is the X here, and thickening and inflammatory changes at the tendon were found to correspond to the area of thickening, warmth, and tenderness on palpation of this patient. 00:08:39And you should note the structural integrity of the tendon is maintained, although there's considerable inflammation within the superficial aspects, and the inflammation that you should see or you should be aware of here is this. 00:08:53We talked about how fluid is dark, so we look at this pocket and it's incredibly dark compared to the other side. 00:09:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:03This is all pretty continuous here, these fibers going through. 00:09:08And this, we can still see the fibers in there, right, just barely, and it's just much darker, which is indicative of fluid, which suggests inflammation. 00:09:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00  darker, which is indicative of fluid, which suggests inflammation. 00:09:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:24And the imaging characteristics on ultrasound ligaments are also hyperechoic relative to muscle. 00:09:31So they're a little brighter than muscle, but again, a little darker than tendon and then darker than bone. 00:09:39And you should again see a distinct pattern of fibers, but a little more compact than the fibers that we would see in tendons. 00:09:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:49So here we're looking at a longitudinal view of a normal anterior talofibular ligament on the left side. 00:09:57And then the arrows indicate the fibers of the ligament extending from the fibula over here to the [UNKNOWN] over here, and you can see those fibers [INAUDIBLE] this way. 00:10:13Now KNOWN] over here, and you can see those fibers [INAUDIBLE] this way. 00:10:13Now the image on the right, is a torn talofibular ligament, and the arrows indicate the disruption, but the arrowhead also points to the residual stump of a torn ligament, right, so right here. 00:10:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:30This stump, and then we can see this sort of really dark area, again. 00:10:36[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:48So the characteristics of muscles on ultrasound imaging. 00:10:51Muscles are hypoechoic, so they're darker relative to the surrounding fascia or the tendons, or especially the bone. 00:11:00And we should see fibrous bands of fascia in longitudinal views as parallel hyperechoic bands that appear brighter than the rest of the muscle. 00:  of fascia in longitudinal views as parallel hyperechoic bands that appear brighter than the rest of the muscle. 00:11:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:13So what that means is that you have this area where things in general are pretty dark, but within that area we should see these bright bands 00:11:25[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:28And so in this picture, what we're looking at on the left is a longitudinal view of a normal gluteus medius. 00:11:37And on the right, a gluteus medius that's fibrosed. 00:11:42The fibrosis is of unknown cause, but may be linked to degenerative changes in the hip. 00:11:47What you should note here is the generally hyperechoic appearance of the fibrosed muscle, with prominent fiber strands compared to the somewhat hypoechoic normal muscle. 00 ic appearance of the fibrosed muscle, with prominent fiber strands compared to the somewhat hypoechoic normal muscle. 00:12:00And so here we see on this side on the left side, you can see how it's dark. 00:12:06And we look on the right side, we can see these really much brighter fiber strands in that muscle. 00:12:16Note the subcutaneous fat and the fascia, and the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus muscles. 00:12:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:33So the imaging characteristics of bursa. 00:12:35What we'll see is a fluid filled space, and we may see a hypoechoic line, a little bit of a brighter line, and the fluid and space don't reflect sound well, so they're dark. 00:12:45And this line is between two or more hyperecho  reflect sound well, so they're dark. 00:12:45And this line is between two or more hyperechoic structures, so between bone and tendon, or between tendon and muscle. 00:12:55And so what we're seeing here is the triceps and this is olecranon in this dark area. 00:13:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:08And this is a mildly inflamed olecranon bursa proximal to the elbow. 00:13:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:20So the imaging characteristics of cartilage. 00:13:22We'll see a hypoechoic layer, a really dark layer, next to a hypoechoic cortical bone, and so we see in the left here, here's the bone, and then you see this dark area right up above it. 00:13:36The thin arrows point to this cart , and then you see this dark area right up above it. 00:13:36The thin arrows point to this cartilage, and the thick arrows point to the trochlear notch. 00:13:43So the thick arrows point to the bone and the thin arrows point to the cartilage. 00:13:49On this side over here is our lateral condyle and over here is our medial condyle, and then the star is a quadriceps tendon. 00:14:01And so on the image on the left we're looking at normal cartilage, and on the right, and we're here, we're looking at severe degeneration, and that results in this lack of space here. 00:14:12[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:25And so the imaging characteristics of nerves, and this is looking from an axial point of view and they will be hypoechoic, so a little darker relative to tendon, but  from an axial point of view and they will be hypoechoic, so a little darker relative to tendon, but a little brighter or hyperechoic relative to muscle. 00:14:39And in a longitudinal view, we'll see a striated pattern, and in a transverse view, we'll see a speckled kind of pattern. 00:14:48And FDS here is flexed digitorum superficialis. 00:14:52And flexor digitorium profundus, and the circle here is the median move, okay, and so we can see this sort of speckling. 00:15:06So this is an image of the carpal tunnel with the focus on the median nerve. 00:15:10[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:15:16And so now, look at the imaging characteristics of nerve from a longitudinal view. 00:15:22And so longitudinal scan, here on the left  at the imaging characteristics of nerve from a longitudinal view. 00:15:22And so longitudinal scan, here on the left is a normal and on the right is a compressed median nerve. 00:15:31And so this is the longitudinal scan of the palmar aspect of the wrist on the right, you can see a ganglion, and that's this star area here and that's deep to the flexor digitorium. 00:15:45And the cyst displaces the tendon anteriorly and causes compression of the median nerve, and that's what the arrowheads are here, right? 00:15:54So in this one, we can see that the median nerve is getting compressed, and look on this one, the space is much more open, 00:16:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:16:10Okay? 00:16:10[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | whatâ€™s in your Okay? 00:16:10[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | whatâ€™s in your video? | cielo24.com  to take away here, 00:01:47[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:49Is given that we're discussing echogenicity, we're talking about how bright the images are. 00:01:55And so we can see that the bone, 00:01:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:00Is, 00:02:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:03Pretty bright here and that that same bone, it's pretty bright here. 00:02:09And we can see that the biceps tendon is pretty bright, and we can see that the biceps tendon lying on top of that bone is pretty bright. 00:02:20And then we compare that to the deltoid here, which is dark, and we compare that right here, it's dark. 00:02:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:30[INAUDIBLE] of  dark. 00:02:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:30[INAUDIBLE] of slides here, 00:02:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:39Right? 00:02:40[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:42You look at the bone here, see how bright it is? 00:02:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:47That bone, right, and you can see, 00:02:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:52How that deltoid muscle, a lot of it is, 00:02:55[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:56Hyperechoic. 00:02:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:00So structures that reflect a lot of energy are hyperechoic compared with their surrounding structures and structures that reflect very little energy are  structures that reflect a lot of energy are hyperechoic compared with their surrounding structures and structures that reflect very little energy are hypoechoic. 00:03:15And when structures reflect no energy, they're referred to as anechoic. 00:03:19So hyperechoic produce very bright images and waves are reflected off of hypoechoic tissues to produce really dark images. 00:03:29[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:32So, at the very top we have echoic and at the very bottom we have anechoic. 00:03:37So as we saw on the, [INAUDIBLE] right? 00:03:40So those are hyperechoic structures, and if we recall that deltoid muscle, that's more hypoechoic. 00:03:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:57So, when we look at tissue appearances on musculos 52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:57So, when we look at tissue appearances on musculoskeletal ultrasound, we can see that in general muscle is going to be interspersed with these dark spaces here that are hypoechoic. 00:04:10We see bone, and bone's going to be very hyperechoic, right? 00:04:18Very bright fluid on the other hand, it's very dark hypoechoic. 00:04:27And then we can see tendon here, tends to be much brighter, and that's the underlying bone. 00:04:33[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:37And the ligament in between there, it's also fairly dark. 00:04:42So, your bone is consistently going to be your brightest area, and your fluid going to consistently be your darkest areas. 00:04:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:  and your fluid going to consistently be your darkest areas. 00:04:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:01And we can see that here, if we look, for example, at this bone, you can see this very bright outer shell here, like that. 00:05:14Outer area of the bone, and on the inside, no signal from the cortical bone, and you can see that right here, where I drew these arrows. 00:05:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:30And so we can see that in here. 00:05:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:42So regarding the imaging characteristics of bone, the ultrasound does not penetrate bone. 00:05:47So you have this very bright signal at the bone-soft tissue interface. 00:05:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:53And no signal is returned from the cortical  00:05:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:53And no signal is returned from the cortical bone, so the result is dark. 00:05:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:04So this is to display some of the imaging characteristics of bone and the arrows are the greater tuberosity. 00:06:12And so we have a longitudinal view of the supraspinatus, showing the smooth cortical outline of a normal humeral head on the left. 00:06:22[INAUDIBLE] 00:06:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:30And on the right, we can see these degenerative changes and a partial tear of the supraspinatus tendon. 00:06:38So here, you can see how this is much less smooth, 00:06:44[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:48Than this side, 00: , 00:06:44[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:48Than this side, 00:06:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:51Right, smooth, and not smooth. 00:06:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:59And then the tear in the supraspinatus is this area where we can see how it's darker in here. 00:07:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:11All right, so we can also see in this picture, here's the deltoid. 00:07:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:16Right up here, the greater tuberosity is this lump right there, and the junction between the tendon of the supraspinatus and the muscle, which is right in there. 00:07:31[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:41So the normal  is right in there. 00:07:31[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:41So the normal imaging characteristics of tendons, tendons are also hyperechoic, they're bright relative to muscle. 00:07:47Now, they're not as bright as bone, but often you can see a distinct pattern of parallel fibers in a longitudinal image and a pattern of dense spotted fibers in a transverse image. 00:08:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:06And so here we're looking at a longitudinal view of an Achilles tendon on the left side and an inflamed tendon on the right side. 00:08:15And so you would note the Achilles tendon, which is this star here, all right? 00:08:21[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:25And the soleus muscle, which is the X here, and thickening and inflammatory changes at the tendon were found to correspond 8.5 Strengths and Limitations of MSK USEffects00:00:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:02So lecture five, musculoskeletal ultrasound, summary of indications and limitations. 00:00:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:11So our objectives for this lecture are to describe, in general, which structures tend to image hyperechoic, hypoechoic, and anechoic. 00:00:20So which structures tend to be brighter and which tend to be darker? 00:00:25And then we want to be able to summarize indications for musculoskeletal ultrasound, and finally identify limitations of musculoskeletal ultrasound. 00:00:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:38Imaging characteristics of ultrasound, normal and abnormal findings, I'd suggest you review your McKinnis book table 6.1. 00:00:47  normal and abnormal findings, I'd suggest you review your McKinnis book table 6.1. 00:00:47Cortical bone, tendons, ligaments, and nerves are hyperechoic relative to their surrounding tissue. 00:00:53And muscle, bursa, and hyaline cartilage or hypoechoic relative to their surrounding tissue, while cysts are anechoic, they're very dark. 00:01:03So have a general idea that cortical bones, tendon, ligament, nerve are generally brighter relative to the surrounding tissue. 00:01:12And have a general idea that muscle, bursa, hyaline cartilage tend to be darker, along with cysts. 00:01:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:26So a summary of indications for musculoskeletal ultrasound, bones, muscle tears, and tendon pathologies. 00:01:33So for bones, joint oskeletal ultrasound, bones, muscle tears, and tendon pathologies. 00:01:33So for bones, joint effusion and synovitis, some kinds of fractures, particularly long bones, degenerative or inflammatory changes at a joint. 00:01:43Muscle tears, including hamstring, gastric, biceps, etc. 00:01:48Tendon pathologies such as tears, tendinosis, tenosynovitis. 00:01:53Ultrasound can only image the cortical outline of bone, and is therefore limited when compared with CT and MRI. 00:02:01Enthesopathy, which entails roughening of bone at the attachment of tendons or ligaments, commonly associated with degenerative or inflammatory changes can generally be viewed with ultrasound. 00:02:13Regarding muscles, ultrasound is just as accurate as MRI, and additionally provides some intricate details of the muscles internal architecture. 00:02:21Ultras  as accurate as MRI, and additionally provides some intricate details of the muscles internal architecture. 00:02:21Ultrasound is as accurate as MRI for measuring the cross-sectional area of muscles. 00:02:26Regarding tendons, ultrasound can demonstrate the internal architecture of tendons. 00:02:32And ultrasound clearly shows the fibers within a tendon, and can therefore reveal pathological changes that aren't easily diagnosed with MRI. 00:02:41[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:46Regarding ligamentous ruptures, mononeuropathies, ganglion cysts, and bursitis. 00:02:53We used to look at ligamentous ruptures, median and ulnar neuropathies, ganglion cysts, and bursitis. 00:03:01So regarding ligaments, the ultrasound imaging of ligaments rivals that of MRI, with the added advantages of a better display of fiber structure and the ability  the ultrasound imaging of ligaments rivals that of MRI, with the added advantages of a better display of fiber structure and the ability to perform stress tests during the examination process. 00:03:14With regards to nerves, the ultrasound could demonstrate inflammation of a nerve and changes in your diameter that indicate entrapment neuropathies 00:03:22[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:25Cysts and bursa can be viewed in great detail, including debris from adjacent joints or even thickened synovial tissue. 00:03:33[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:38Some of the biggest limitations of musculoskeletal ultrasound include that it's operator dependent, and then it's largely affected by how obese a patient is. 00:03:47Acoustic energy is lost in the tissue, and obtaining a correct focal length for ultrasound is problematic in obese patients. 00:03:57And compared to other imaging methods, ultrasound is  correct focal length for ultrasound is problematic in obese patients. 00:03:57And compared to other imaging methods, ultrasound is more operator dependent. 00:04:02Also, structures deep to bone are not visualized, such as intra-articular ligaments and inter substance issues. 00:04:09Ultrasound isn't cross air, making it difficult to visualize structures that are obscured by air in the lungs, or gas in the intestine.
