00:02:54Any progressive loss of strength? 00:02:56Any increasing frequency of tripping, or have you experienced a fall recently? 00:03:02Asking the patient about any other complaints like nausea, fever, abdominal pain, upper back, or shoulder pain could be useful for suggesting follow-up questions or screening to rule out serious pathology. 00:03:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:17Overlapping pain patterns, and one of the important things that you'll see frequently here in these presentations is to see a specific table and this one is table 5.1 in your book. 00:03:30Your book also includes a number of boxes and figures and I'll refer to those quite often. 00:03:38It just seems to be the the format of the book and that's how the author put it together. 00:03:43Lots of tables, lots of figures, lots of boxes. 00:  the author put it together. 00:03:43Lots of tables, lots of figures, lots of boxes. 00:03:48So there's considerable overlap between pain referred from musculoskeletal structures and pain associated with visceral disorders. 00:03:57Certain pain descriptions may be unusual for musculoskeletal pain. 00:04:02So vascular disorders could present with a patient complaining of throbbing or pounding or pulsating kinds of symptoms. 00:04:09Neurologic disorder could present with symptoms that a patient might describe as sharp or shocking or burning. 00:04:18And visceral disorders could present with symptoms such as aching, squeezing, gnawing, burning or cramping. 00:04:26The symptom descriptions alone don't really contain enough information to diagnose or base any kind of referral. 00:04:32Knowledge of potential pain location patterns associated with viscera can guide the PT and selecting the organ systems to  a stretch is applied to the involved muscle. 00:07:32Keep in mind the six Ps of compartment syndrome, pain, palpable tenderness, paraesthesia, paresis, pallor, and pulselessness. 00:07:42So, with compartment syndrome the physical examination typically reveals swelling, tenderness and palpable tension of the involved compartment. 00:07:52The nerve entrapment or compression found in this condition results in paresthesias, and potentially in paralysis. 00:07:59The vascular compromise accompanying this condition results in diminished peripheral pulses and, potentially, a change in skin color. 00:08:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:14Finally, septic arthritis and cellulitis continuing in the knee, lower leg, ankle, and foot. 00:08:19Septic arthritis is an inflammation in a joint caused by a bacterial infection. 00:08:24Cellulitis is an infection in the skin after a  film moves in an opposite direction from the X-ray tube. 00:06:43Right, so, here we have our X-ray tube up here. 00:06:46Here we have our film down here and they move in opposite directions. 00:06:54The focal point, which is right here, that open circle remains in sharp focus while the other planes of the body, the dark circles become blurred by the motion. 00:07:07So imaging different depths of bone can allow a better understanding of the extent of a fracture, give you a little more information about it. 00:07:15And the evaluation of bony tumors can also be aided by conventional tomography. 00:07:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:27So, as opposed to conventional tomography, this is computed tomography, and what it does is it merges images from X-rays using a computer. 00:07:36Which reconstructs  and what it does is it merges images from X-rays using a computer. 00:07:36Which reconstructs an axial cross-sectional slice of an image. 00:07:41And then processing can also reconstruct the data obtained in one plane and resolve it into multiple other planes. 00:07:47So, for example, data obtained in the axial plane can be resolved into sagittal, coronal, and even three-dimensional images like we see here. 00:07:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:01And so, this oblique view of the wrist demonstrates a fracture through the waist of the scaphoid bone that's been complicated by avascular necrosis of the proximal fragment. 00:08:13So, we see here an S right here, this fracture, 00:08:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:20And one there. 00:08:22And then the 17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:20And one there. 00:08:22And then the avascular necrosis down here. 00:08:25[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:30And so tumors of bone and soft tissue, fractures, joint abnormalities, bone fragments, and metabolic bone disorders can all benefit from the use of Computed Tomography 00:08:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:51So nuclear imaging, nuclear imaging uses radiopharmaceuticals or radioactive tracers to diagnose based on the physiological or the functional changes of the tissue or organ. 00:09:05And so, the pharma side targets a particular organ while the radionuclide emits gamma rays. 00:09:12And the tracers are absorbed by the target organ in varying amounts based on the level of metabolic activity in the tissue. 00:09:21So, in this image here, a 16-  on the level of metabolic activity in the tissue. 00:09:21So, in this image here, a 16-year-old girl is diagnosed with lymphoma and sent for PET/CT scan before starting chemotherapy. 00:09:33And you can see how the metabolic data from the PET scan and the anatomic data from the CT scan are combined. 00:09:41So, here's the PET scan right here, and here's the CT scan and we combine the two. 00:09:49To get this the pet CT scan and the tumor uses the tracer as fuel, and so it ends up lighting up with increased uptake. 00:10:01And that seen in the right upper region of the chest. 00:10:04[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:10:07And, apparently, after six months of chemotherapy, a repeat scan showed a significant reduction of the tumor, indicating that the treatment was successful. 00:10:  of chemotherapy, a repeat scan showed a significant reduction of the tumor, indicating that the treatment was successful. 00:10:18But I think the important takeaway here is understanding that you're taking the image qualities of the PET scan here, combining them with the CT scan, to produce this image here. 00:10:32So this is extremely useful in detecting tumors or tumor progression or regression. 00:10:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:46So radionuclide Imaging studies, radionuclide bone scan or bone scan or bone scintigraphy, really increased uptake of tracers generally occur under abnormal conditions where there's high metabolic activity. 00:11:03And this is visualized as black areas or hot spots on an image. 00:11:09And so bone scans highlight areas of hyperfunction or increased mineral turnover. 00:11:16So if we look at image A here, bone scans of three different patients, each  mineral turnover. 00:11:16So if we look at image A here, bone scans of three different patients, each with three different diagnoses, degenerative arthritis and metastatic cancer and acute trauma. 00:11:29The point is that all the scans look alike because they only measure hypermetabolism. 00:11:35Thus, bone scans are not independent studies, but they have to be corelated with clinical data to be meaningful. 00:11:42And so image A, the patient has a degenerative joint disease in multiple sites. 00:11:47And so we can see, the arrows indicating increased uptake in the cervical spine. 00:11:55Here, see how it's black, and the wrist here, it's black, and in the ankles. 00:12:03You can also see in the knee here. 00:12:07And that actually is a prosthesis at the knee joint, so a total knee replacement. 00 . 00:12:07And that actually is a prosthesis at the knee joint, so a total knee replacement. 00:12:14And then if we look at E right there, that patient suffered a bruise to their glute medius muscle during football game. 00:12:23And increase uptake was an early indication of myositis ossificans developing in the muscle, so these two things here. 00:12:32So this person either landed on that side or someone hit them here, and now we have this development of bone that's turning over at a much increased rate versus everywhere else in the pelvis. 00:12:49Then if we look at C here, this patient has known lung cancer and the bone scan is done to identify the distribution of metastatic lesions in the skeleton. 00:13:00And increased uptake at the right scapula and the right shoulder shows areas of metastatic bone cancer so that's here and so that  uptake at the right scapula and the right shoulder shows areas of metastatic bone cancer so that's here and so that's the scapula. 00:13:12What? 00:13:13Over the top of that thing. 00:13:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:19So anyway, here and here. 00:13:24And so, we can see this is the right shoulder here's the humerus coming down here, and here's the torso there. 00:13:31[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:36So, the limitation here is just this lack of specificity, right? 00:13:39All we can see is that there's bone turnover. 00:13:41We're not able to distinguish what process is causing the increased uptake of bone or the increased bone turnover. 00:13:48So, you have to have other clinical evaluations. 00:13:51  the increased bone turnover. 00:13:48So, you have to have other clinical evaluations. 00:13:51Correlated with your bone scan in order to make a diagnosis for radionuclide bone scan or bone scintigraphy. 00:13:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:06So magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, no ionizing radiation is produced by the MRI, and the inflammation is instead produced by the interaction of the tissue with a magnetic field. 00:14:22MRI is primarily used in the evaluation of soft tissue trauma and joint derangement and tumors. 00:14:29And so this image here is an MRI of the cervical spine. 00:14:35And in a here you can see the pons and B, you can see the spinal cord and C you can see the marrow of the C two vertebral body and D you can Visualize the, the intervertebral disc,C4,  of the C two vertebral body and D you can Visualize the, the intervertebral disc,C4, and five, right? 00:14:56So here's four, here's five, here's the disc. 00:15:00Right? 00:15:01Here's three. 00:15:02[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:15:16So ultrasonography or musculoskeletal ultrasound. 00:15:21These images are generated using reflected sound waves. 00:15:25Like an MRI, there's no exposure to ionizing radiation, and it's non-invasive imaging. 00:15:34Different tissues absorb and reflect the sound waves uniquely. 00:15:39Diagnostic ultrasound is useful for lesions to muscles and tendons, ligaments, detection of cysts and soft tissue tumors. 00:15:48And for the measurement of blood flow. 00:15:52One  in a joint caused by a bacterial infection. 00:08:24Cellulitis is an infection in the skin after a wound becomes contaminated by bacteria. 00:08:30Patients who have septic arthritis complain of a constant aching or throbbing pain and a swelling in a joint. 00:08:37The involved joint is usually tender and warm when palpated. 00:08:40And depending on which joint is involved, erythema may be present. 00:08:44Patients who develop septic arthritis often are immunosuppressed or have pre-existing systemic joint disease. 00:08:54An infection in the tissues, cellulitis, exhibits the classic signs of pain, skin swelling, warmth. 00:09:01And advancing irregular margin of erythema or reddish streaks, suspicion of either septic arthritis or cellulitis would warrant an immediate referral of the patient to a physician. 00:09:15[BLANK_ sts and soft tissue tumors. 00:15:48And for the measurement of blood flow. 00:15:52One meaningful advantage of ultrasound is that the images can be made during the physical examination of tissues, such as during muscle contractions or passive stretching, or even while performing special tests. 00:16:05So it's a very functional kind of imaging runs there the patient remaining static like they would be for an MRI or an X-ray. 00:16:15The patient can actually be moving and you can visualize the structures as they move through space. 00:16:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:16:31The functional view of imaging starts with the patient and the evaluation, including the history and the physical. 00:16:38As opposed, you decide that something doesn't seem quite right, so you refer the patient out for imaging, and the patient undergoes imaging, the report's generated, the radiologist makes the diagnosis. 00  patient out for imaging, and the patient undergoes imaging, the report's generated, the radiologist makes the diagnosis. 00:16:51And then proceed with treatment either a physical therapy or physical therapy is not appropriate with some other kinds of treatments. 00:16:59Essentially, diagnostic imaging is a link in a larger chain that starts and ends with the patient. 00:17:06So you have a picture or an image, but humans play a critical role in the imaging system. 00:17:12Through their interpretation of the image and by their correlation of the clinical findings with the information from that imaging. 00:17:19So the clinicians responsibility really is to recognize that if the results of imaging that imaging study don't fit the physical findings, then further clinical evaluation and diagnostic investigation are warranted. 00:17:35[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00: AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:02:51Number 5 is the belief that every possible step is being taken to obtain a diagnosis, and so the clinician's need for action and certainty, right? 00:03:01A PT may need to feel secure that they have taken every possible step to solve the puzzle of obtaining a diagnosis. 00:03:09So to resolve uncertainty, does bringing the radiologist into the decision making process really add value, does it cause harm? 00:03:17In other words, occasionally during this process, a clinician may feel that more is always considered better, but it may be useful to consider, for example, how much better and at what cost? 00:03:32So be careful of using radiologic examination as a form of psychotherapy that gives some kind of degree of assurance or reassurance that may or may not be justified. 00  a form of psychotherapy that gives some kind of degree of assurance or reassurance that may or may not be justified. 00:03:44Taking an action, such as ordering imaging, whether or not it improves the ability to treat the underlying condition, really offers little benefit to the patient. 00:03:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:01So continuing with unnecessary examinations, why is there overutilization of x-rays? 00:04:09Well, part of it is patient demand. 00:04:11The patient may request an x-ray, whether or not it's relevant. 00:04:14For example, demanding an x-ray of an ankle, following a sprain, despite evidence from a set of rules indicating that imaging is probably not going to be incredibly useful. 00:04:25Reimbursement policies, when imaging is covered, you may be less concerned about the economic burden on patients. 00:04 imbursement policies, when imaging is covered, you may be less concerned about the economic burden on patients. 00:04:32But as costs rise, or patients are required to fund, the likelihood of you ordering imaging may decline. 00:04:42Number 3, defensive medicine, so this really concerns the idea of malpractice. 00:04:51So back in the 1970s, research already suggested around 30% of x-rays were performed defensively by clinicians who may have been concerned about taking every possible step to guarantee that nothing has been missed. 00:05:06Regardless of the cost or the potential harm in terms of financial, or radiation, or the things that we've discussed previously. 00:05:15So there's a belief that if a finding is not documented, that the provider could be sued. 00:05:21And experts in the field suggest that these types of examinations are not valid, and that future litigation may instead result from unnecessary radiation exposure  experts in the field suggest that these types of examinations are not valid, and that future litigation may instead result from unnecessary radiation exposure, because of needless examinations rather than from too few examinations. 00:05:35Finally, economic incentive, so physician-owned imaging units, staff in these offices ordering their own imaging, interpreting them, and rendering charges. 00:05:45There's an incentive to perform more rather than fewer imaging studies. 00:05:51Even 40 years ago, non-radiologist physicians who owned their own extra equipment used an average of twice as many x-ray examinations as their colleagues who referred out to radiologists. 00:06:04So in summary, unnecessary radiological examinations can result in excess costs, excess radiation, wasting a patient's time, wasting a clinician's time, false hope and expectations, increased worry over findings which are not clinically meaningful. 00:06:21And they indicate a breakdown in the logical thought pattern concerning the patient's work  are not clinically meaningful. 00:06:21And they indicate a breakdown in the logical thought pattern concerning the patient's workup. 00:06:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:35So examples of unnecessary examinations then, and these are all taken from a radiology textbook for radiology residents. 00:06:45So taking imaging of a nasal bone to rule out a broken nose. 00:06:49And this is unnecessary because if there's a fracture of a nasal bone, it won't be casted and it will not be reduced, and no treatment will be given regardless of what the x-ray shows. 00:07:01Even if the nasal bone is displaced badly enough to warrant an intervention, a CT facial series to be useful only to search for additional fractures. 00:07:11How about rib imaging? 00:07:13Well, fractured ribs are not uncommon, however, finding a rib fracture after trauma has almost no ? 00:07:13Well, fractured ribs are not uncommon, however, finding a rib fracture after trauma has almost no clinical significance and really does not alter treatment. 00:07:23A pneumothorax or even a lung contusion may be ruled out by chest films, but a rib series isn't necessary. 00:07:30A rib x-ray on a patient with rib pain to find a fracture that really serves little purpose other than to find a cause for the pain, and eliminating this series of rib imaging really will not change the course of the patient's treatment. 00:07:45Coccyx imaging to rule out a fracture isn't necessary because a fracture of the coccyx will not be casted or reduced, just like the nasal bone. 00:07:54So in addition, a meaningfully higher dose of gonadal radiation results from a coccyx x-ray. 00:08:01So because no change in treatment will  gonadal radiation results from a coccyx x-ray. 00:08:01So because no change in treatment will occur, regardless of imaging results, coccyx imaging is likely not necessary. 00:08:09Lumbar spine, so these x-rays, research suggests, are the most abused examinations of radiology. 00:08:16They result in the highest gonadal radiation dose of any x-ray examination, equivalent to a daily chest x-ray for six years. 00:08:25And in the vast majority of cases, they offer no useful diagnostic information. 00:08:31In patients under 40, there is almost no x-ray plain film finding that can be linked to the acute problem or that can be treated with an intervention linked to findings from imaging. 00:08:42Disc herniation cannot be identified. 00:08:44Tumors or infections are not usually considered unless there are specific criteria such as atyp  identified. 00:08:44Tumors or infections are not usually considered unless there are specific criteria such as atypical pain, intravenous drug use for other potential causes of infection, history of cancer, etc. 00:08:56So instead, regardless of the findings on the x-ray image, modalities to reduce pain along with exercise or advice to stay active will invariably be the treatment of choice. 00:09:08A lumbar spine x-ray series may be useful in cases of severe trauma, or possible metastatic tumor, or infection. 00:09:16Acute low back pain with, sorry, acute low back pain with radiculopathy is not an indication for x-rays. 00:09:23An MRI would be more useful for showing a disk herniation, but that should only be considered after conservative treatments such as physical therapy has failed. 00:09:33And ankle series, around 30,000 of these were  arthritis or cellulitis would warrant an immediate referral of the patient to a physician. 00:09:15[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:03:09The slump test to detect meningitis has a positive likelihood ratio of 0.97. 00:03:15So, this is not a great test for detecting meningitis. 00:03:21A history of breast, or lung cancer, or melanoma may increase the likelihood of brain tumor as a source of pain. 00:03:28Subarachnoid hemorrhage may result in headache, meningeal irritation, fever, photophobia, nausea, vomiting, or neurologic dysfunction. 00:03:40So regarding meningitis, an unexplained and progressive fever in children under the age of two, should warrant an immediate physician consult. 00:03:50Patients may demonstrate difficulty actively or passively  conservative treatments such as physical therapy has failed. 00:09:33And ankle series, around 30,000 of these were reported every day in North America, and they're the most common cause for emergency department visits. 00:09:43An evidence-based history and physical examination using the American College of Radiology criteria and the Ottawa ankle rules can reduce ankle imaging by 50% without ever missing a fracture. 00:09:55So tiny bony avulsions in the foot and ankle will be treated the same as ligament tears. 00:10:01So because x-ray is not a factor in determining the patient's treatment, it can probably be avoided. 00:10:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:08The cervical spine and the cervical spine x-ray series, emergency departments routinely order C-pine films on all trauma patients because they're worried about not stabilizing a fractured back. 00:10:21Research has demonstrated consistently that  all trauma patients because they're worried about not stabilizing a fractured back. 00:10:21Research has demonstrated consistently that patients who are alert and have no C-spine pain have almost no chance of having a fracture. 00:10:30If the patient doesn't lag and has no pain with cervical motion, no posterior midline tenderness, and no neurologic deficits, no C-spine x-rays should be performed. 00:10:41In the case of trauma, you can usually skip plain film and the patient is likely going to go straight to a CT scan to ensure that fractures are moved out. 00:10:49However, a CT may not show ligamentous disruption, but should be more easily seen on MRI. 00:10:55So in sum, there are a lot of things that typically will receive imaging, but from an evidence-based standpoint, probably the imaging isn't absolutely necessary. 00:11:08[BLANK_  but from an evidence-based standpoint, probably the imaging isn't absolutely necessary. 00:11:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:14Interpreting images in radiology, develop a search pattern and understand that the diagnosis is going to be complicated by normal anatomic variance, multiple diagnoses such as the second fracture. 00:11:28And the second fracture refers to when we become so fixated on diagnosing a particular fracture in a certain area that we end up missing a meaningful fracture in a separate area. 00:11:42Letter C, variations in how a disease may present, and D, insignificant findings, which become significant over time. 00:11:51So using a search pattern may seem to make diagnosing easy, but the interpretation can actually be very difficult. 00:11:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:02So interpreting images in radiology, the pitfalls. 00:12:07Number 1, we ] 00:12:02So interpreting images in radiology, the pitfalls. 00:12:07Number 1, we have errors of observation, 2, errors of interpretation. 00:12:13And 3, we can reduce errors by learning to appropriately communicate with the radiologist. 00:12:22So errors of observation have to do with a faulty search pattern usually. 00:12:27Errors of interpretation are the practitioner's failure to link abnormal radiologic signs to meaningful clinical data. 00:12:36And errors in reading images are inevitable. 00:12:40You just have to accept that they're going to occur, and occasionally things will be missed. 00:12:45[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:03:16And so one of the things you'll notice with imaging is that often, the things that you're looking for are really 16And so one of the things you'll notice with imaging is that often, the things that you're looking for are really subtle, and so it's right in between those red lines, we can see that. 00:03:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:30I think the most important thing I'll have you take away from this slide was really the brightness of the outer edges of the bone on the left image, that healthy femur, and the less dense center of the femur. 00:03:44And then on the right image, noticing how transparent or darker that femur is versus the healthy femur on the left. 00:03:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:57So number 2 under bone density is textural abnormalities. 00:04:02And we're going to look for changes in appearance of the trabeculae, and changes in mineralization, which result in changes in the appearance  for changes in appearance of the trabeculae, and changes in mineralization, which result in changes in the appearance of the trabeculae. 00:04:12And so when the mineralization of the bone is altered, the appearance of the trabeculae is also altered. 00:04:17So the altered trabeculae appearance is often a radiologic hallmark in the diagnosis of disease processes. 00:04:24The image of the trabeculae is often described in terms like textures such as thin or delicate, or [UNKNOWN], smudge, or fluffy. 00:04:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:39So in this slide, the picture on the left is decalcification due to hyperparathyroidism. 00:04:46And on the right, we have cortical thinning as a result of Cooley's anemia. 00:04:51So on  the right, we have cortical thinning as a result of Cooley's anemia. 00:04:51So on the left, this is a previously healthy 21-year-old man who'd been troubled for the last 18 months by progressive loss of strength in his legs. 00:05:02And he was found to have primary hyperparathyroidism due to a tumor of the parathyroid. 00:05:09And the radiograph of his leg shows these generalized skeletal changes with considerable decalcification of the bones and erosions of the cortex. 00:05:19And so we can see here, if we look at the tibia, even the cortex, and we can see what we're looking for is this sort of straight line, and we're not seeing that, right, we're sort of seeing these edges that are kind of rough. 00:05:34And then even within the texture of the inside of the bone here is just  are kind of rough. 00:05:34And then even within the texture of the inside of the bone here is just normal translucent. 00:05:43And on the right, what we're looking at is this lacy appearance of the trabeculae of the upper extremity of this child due to Cooley's anemia, and that's an inherited blood disorder that results in destruction of red blood cells. 00:05:59The metacarpals and the phalanges show cortical thickening and osteopenia. 00:06:05And marrow proliferation results in a loss of normal tubulation, which results in a squared or sausage shape of the bones in the hand. 00:06:14And so if you look at the metacarpals here on this hand, you can see then as opposed to the normal shape, right, they're sort of off. 00:06:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:28  right, they're sort of off. 00:06:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:28And the other thing we're looking at in this image is this lacy appearance of the inside of the bones here, of the trabeculae. 00:06:37[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:43So number 3 under bone density is local density changes. 00:06:48And so we're assessing for localized changes in the bone density. 00:06:51So we're looking for increases in bone density in weight-bearing areas, like sclerosis, as well as excessive increases in osteoarthritic conditions and reactive changes, which occur when the body acts to contain a diseased area. 00:07:06So sclerosis or normal increases in bone density are seen in areas that are subjected to increased physical stress, such as the weight-bearing areas of joints. 00:07:17These areas of localized sclerosis are  increased physical stress, such as the weight-bearing areas of joints. 00:07:17These areas of localized sclerosis are actually signs of repair, where extra bone is deposited to fortify the bony architecture to withstand the forces of weight-bearing. 00:07:29Excessive sclerosis, that can be normal, so when bone is healing, it forms a callus as if remodeled, but it can also occur during degenerative changes such as arthritis. 00:07:44And reactive sclerosis, that occurs during conditions such as reaction to a tumor or cancer, and the body may lay down bone as it attempts to surround and contain the diseased area. 00:07:56[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:00So in this slide on the left, we're looking at degenerative changes of the medial knee. 00:08:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:09And so in this AP view of the knee, what  the age of two, should warrant an immediate physician consult. 00:03:50Patients may demonstrate difficulty actively or passively flexing the neck and inability to touch the chin to the chest. 00:03:57Although your text suggests using the slump test to screen for meningitis, use of it to diagnose meningitis was developed in the pre-antibiotic era and in patients with severe late-stage, untreated bacterial and tuberculosis meningitis. 00:04:13A recent study involving 297 adults with suspected meningitis revealed the positive likelihood ratio of 0.97, as I mentioned above. 00:04:23And it did not accurately discriminate between patients with and without meningitis. 00:04:29The test demonstrated diagnostic value in only four patients who had severe meningeal inflammation. 00:04:36Instead, a headache that worsens after horizontally rotating the head at a frequency of two to three times per second may be more sensitive with a :06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:09And so in this AP view of the knee, what you should see is this classic radiographic hallmark of arthritis, which is demonstrated by decreased medial joint space combined with sclerotic subchondral bone of the medial tibial plateau, and that's what's in this oval. 00:08:27So we can see that the space here is narrowed. 00:08:31And then we can also see, 00:08:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:35This wide, 00:08:37[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:39Subchondral bone, that wider sclerosis of the subchondral bone is a reparative response to the thinning of the articular cartilage`. 00:08:47And spurs can also result from the repair attempt, and on the left side, you can see a white arrow pointing to And spurs can also result from the repair attempt, and on the left side, you can see a white arrow pointing to a spur. 00:08:55Now on the right is an image of osteomyelitis. 00:08:58And this nine-year-old girl had a six-month history of progressive, enlarging soft tissue swelling at the right proximal tibia, and she was diagnosed with osteomyelitis at the proximal tibia. 00:09:11And what you should note here is how the region is well circumscribed by the reactive sclerosis of bone as it attempts to surround and wall off the infected area, and that's what the arrows are. 00:09:22So that really great, great, shiny part there, that's bone reacting and trying to wall off. 00:09:30[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:33And in B, the CT axial image further demonstrates that sort of reactive ANK_AUDIO] 00:09:33And in B, the CT axial image further demonstrates that sort of reactive sclerosis of the left tibia, and also reveals the draining effect, and that's the white arrow, which was formed to relieve the pressure of the pus on the bone. 00:09:48And so right here, again, it's very subtle, but you can see that sort of dent right there. 00:09:56So the pus drained out into the soft tissue, which enlarged the circumference of the leg, and that's what we see in this axial view. 00:10:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:10So again, I think the takeaway on the image on the right is just noting how this bone is reactive here, a little brighter as it tries to wall off that area, and especially in the CT down below here. 00:10:24You can really see that brightness. 00:10:  and especially in the CT down below here. 00:10:24You can really see that brightness. 00:10:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:31So continuing with our ABCDs, we're on C, which is cartilage spaces. 00:10:35So number 1 under C is joint space, and we want to assess the width of the joint spaces. 00:10:41Is the joint space well-preserved with normal thickness of cartilage, disk, tissue, right? 00:10:46Recall from our last slide, you saw on that degenerative change in the medial joint line, that joint space was not well-preserved. 00:10:54And then for number 2, if the space is decreased, that's likely the result of degenerative changes. 00:10:59So a well-preserved joint space implies that the cartilage or the disk is of normal thickness. 00:11: So a well-preserved joint space implies that the cartilage or the disk is of normal thickness. 00:11:05And a decreased joint space implies that the cartilage or disk is thinned down as a result of degenerative processes. 00:11:13[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:17So in this slide on the left is degenerative disk disease. 00:11:21An MRI image of a patient with degenerative disk disease, it shows bands of fatty bone marrow parallel to the L5 disk right here. 00:11:32And so we can see this sort of fattiness, and we can see this degenerated disk here. 00:11:39[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:11:48And on the right side, we see degenerative disk disease at the cervical spine. 00:11:53And this lateral view of the cervical spine shows the classic hallmarks of degenerative disk disease at C56 :11:53And this lateral view of the cervical spine shows the classic hallmarks of degenerative disk disease at C56, including a narrow joint space, an osteophyte formation at the vertebral end plates. 00:12:05And so you can see these little spurs popping up there, these osteophytes. 00:12:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:14I think the important thing I would take away from these two images are looking at the difference here in the joint spaces here, 00:12:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:25And compare that with this joint space, and it's the same on the other image, right? 00:12:29And look here at the joint space, and then we'll compare that with this one. 00:12:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:42Continuing with cartilage spaces, number 2, the subchond BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:42Continuing with cartilage spaces, number 2, the subchondral bone. 00:12:47You want to assess the subchondral bone, looking for changes in density or irregularities. 00:12:54And increased sclerosis could be one finding. 00:12:58For example, in osteoarthritis, the subchondral bone becomes increasingly sclerotic as new bone is formed to help withstand the increased stresses directed at it because of the loss of the articular cartilage. 00:13:10So if you recall from a few slides ago, you could see how those brighter areas of bone were created along that medial femur and tibia, as that joint space became more narrow. 00:13:25Then the other thing to be aware of are erosions. 00:13:28So in rheumatoid arthritis or gout, you see very little reparative sclerosis . 00:13:28So in rheumatoid arthritis or gout, you see very little reparative sclerosis in the subchondral bone. 00:13:35And instead, you see erosions of the subchondral bone in the form of radiolucencies of the joint margin. 00:13:42And so what that means is that it's very transparent and it's not the right response that we saw with that sclerotic change. 00:13:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:58So in this image, the left hip joint space narrowing reflects the loss of cartilage and changes in bone density and bony irregularities. 00:14:08So osteoarthritis is a destructive joint disease that can result in pain, it can result in stiffness, as well as a loss of range of motion or a loss of activity tolerance. 00:14:19And X-rays can confirm the diagnosis of  of range of motion or a loss of activity tolerance. 00:14:19And X-rays can confirm the diagnosis of osteoarthritis. 00:14:23So X-rays demonstrate a number of findings in osteoarthritis, although they're not always seen, and they can occur in different variations from individual to individual. 00:14:35So the first thing that we see here is joint space narrowing, and that reflects the loss of cartilage. 00:14:41So we can see the joint space narrowing here, and all through the side when you look at that compared with this joint space. 00:14:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:51The second thing that we can see is sclerosis, which is present in almost all cases of osteoarthritis. 00:14:57And again, sclerosis is that brightness that begins to appear here in reaction to that loss of space and cartilage, right? 00:15  sclerosis is that brightness that begins to appear here in reaction to that loss of space and cartilage, right? 00:15:07And look at the amount of brightness there compared to the right big joint. 00:15:14And finally, there's osteophytes present, so a new bone formation around the joint in reaction to that stress. 00:15:21And then subchondral lucency, which is a focal loss of bone density. 00:15:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:15:36Continuing with cartilage spaces, number 3 are the epiphyseal plates. 00:15:40We want to assess the epiphysis, look for changes in the position of the growth plate or the size of the epiphysis, whether the borders are smooth and whether there's presence of disruption or gaps in the plates. 00:15:54So the position of the growth plate as designated by the relationship of the o  headache that worsens after horizontally rotating the head at a frequency of two to three times per second may be more sensitive with a sensitivity up to 0.97. 00:04:50Regarding brain tumors, although a headache is a symptom associated with a brain tumor, neurologic deficits are a more common symptom in the early and middle stages of this disorder. 00:05:01A change in mentation, vomiting with or without nausea, visual changes, seizures, ataxia and speech impairment are all possible presentations with or without headaches. 00:05:14Symptoms of this type would warrant a detailed neurologic screening. 00:05:18[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:03:06Capitate fractures are the result of trauma involving maximal wrist flexion or extension, however, instead of osteonecrosis. 00:03:14[BLANK_AUDIO]  gaps in the plates. 00:15:54So the position of the growth plate as designated by the relationship of the ossified portion of the secondary epiphysis to the metaphysis. 00:16:03We can see that in figure 221 in your radiology text. 00:16:08And the size of the epiphysis in relation to both the skeletal maturity and the chronological age of the patient has been imaged. 00:16:17Is there's a smooth margin at the borders of the epiphysis, like a band of sclerosis, indicating increased bone activity associated with linear growth? 00:16:27Disruptions in the growth plates from trauma or metabolic disease can be visualized, and those can be difficult to diagnose and they may require contralateral films for comparison. 00:16:37So often, one of the keys in imaging is symmetry, comparing one side to the other side. 00:16:46[BLANK_AUDIO  keys in imaging is symmetry, comparing one side to the other side. 00:16:46[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:03:16And so one of the things you'll notice with imaging is that often, the things that you're looking for are really subtle, and so it's right in between those red lines, we can see that. 00:03:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:30I think the most important thing I'll have you take away from this slide was really the brightness of the outer edges of the bone on the left image, that healthy femur, and the less dense center of the femur. 00:03:44And then on the right image, noticing how transparent or darker that femur is versus the healthy femur on the left. 00:03:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00: ur is versus the healthy femur on the left. 00:03:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:57So number 2 under bone density is textural abnormalities. 00:04:02And we're going to look for changes in appearance of the trabeculae, and changes in mineralization, which result in changes in the appearance of the trabeculae. 00:04:12And so when the mineralization of the bone is altered, the appearance of the trabeculae is also altered. 00:04:17So the altered trabeculae appearance is often a radiologic hallmark in the diagnosis of disease processes. 00:04:24The image of the trabeculae is often described in terms like textures such as thin or delicate, or [UNKNOWN], smudge, or fluffy. 00:04:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:39So in this slide,  or fluffy. 00:04:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:39So in this slide, the picture on the left is decalcification due to hyperparathyroidism. 00:04:46And on the right, we have cortical thinning as a result of Cooley's anemia. 00:04:51So on the left, this is a previously healthy 21-year-old man who'd been troubled for the last 18 months by progressive loss of strength in his legs. 00:05:02And he was found to have primary hyperparathyroidism due to a tumor of the parathyroid. 00:05:09And the radiograph of his leg shows these generalized skeletal changes with considerable decalcification of the bones and erosions of the cortex. 00:05:19And so we can see here, if we look at the tibia, even the cortex, and we can see what we're looking  we can see here, if we look at the tibia, even the cortex, and we can see what we're looking for is this sort of straight line, and we're not seeing that, right, we're sort of seeing these edges that are kind of rough. 00:05:34And then even within the texture of the inside of the bone here is just normal translucent. 00:05:43And on the right, what we're looking at is this lacy appearance of the trabeculae of the upper extremity of this child due to Cooley's anemia, and that's an inherited blood disorder that results in destruction of red blood cells. 00:05:59The metacarpals and the phalanges show cortical thickening and osteopenia. 00:06:05And marrow proliferation results in a loss of normal tubulation, which results in a squared or sausage shape of the bones in the hand. 00:06:14And so  tubulation, which results in a squared or sausage shape of the bones in the hand. 00:06:14And so if you look at the metacarpals here on this hand, you can see then as opposed to the normal shape, right, they're sort of off. 00:06:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:28And the other thing we're looking at in this image is this lacy appearance of the inside of the bones here, of the trabeculae. 00:06:37[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:43So number 3 under bone density is local density changes. 00:06:48And so we're assessing for localized changes in the bone density. 00:06:51So we're looking for increases in bone density in weight-bearing areas, like sclerosis, as well as excessive increases in osteoarthritic conditions and reactive changes, which occur when the body acts to contain a , as well as excessive increases in osteoarthritic conditions and reactive changes, which occur when the body acts to contain a diseased area. 00:07:06So sclerosis or normal increases in bone density are seen in areas that are subjected to increased physical stress, such as the weight-bearing areas of joints. 00:07:17These areas of localized sclerosis are actually signs of repair, where extra bone is deposited to fortify the bony architecture to withstand the forces of weight-bearing. 00:07:29Excessive sclerosis, that can be normal, so when bone is healing, it forms a callus as if remodeled, but it can also occur during degenerative changes such as arthritis. 00:07:44And reactive sclerosis, that occurs during conditions such as reaction to a tumor or cancer, and the body may lay down bone as it attempts to surround and contain the diseased area. 00:07:56[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08  attempts to surround and contain the diseased area. 00:07:56[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:00So in this slide on the left, we're looking at degenerative changes of the medial knee. 00:08:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:09And so in this AP view of the knee, what you should see is this classic radiographic hallmark of arthritis, which is demonstrated by decreased medial joint space combined with sclerotic subchondral bone of the medial tibial plateau, and that's what's in this oval. 00:08:27So we can see that the space here is narrowed. 00:08:31And then we can also see, 00:08:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:35This wide, 00:08:37[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:39Subchondral bone, that wider sclerosis of the subch [BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:39Subchondral bone, that wider sclerosis of the subchondral bone is a reparative response to the thinning of the articular cartilage`. 00:08:47And spurs can also result from the repair attempt, and on the left side, you can see a white arrow pointing to a spur. 00:08:55Now on the right is an image of osteomyelitis. 00:08:58And this nine-year-old girl had a six-month history of progressive, enlarging soft tissue swelling at the right proximal tibia, and she was diagnosed with osteomyelitis at the proximal tibia. 00:09:11And what you should note here is how the region is well circumscribed by the reactive sclerosis of bone as it attempts to surround and wall off the infected area, and that's what the arrows are. 00:09:22So that really  to surround and wall off the infected area, and that's what the arrows are. 00:09:22So that really great, great, shiny part there, that's bone reacting and trying to wall off. 00:09:30[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:33And in B, the CT axial image further demonstrates that sort of reactive sclerosis of the left tibia, and also reveals the draining effect, and that's the white arrow, which was formed to relieve the pressure of the pus on the bone. 00:09:48And so right here, again, it's very subtle, but you can see that sort of dent right there. 00:09:56So the pus drained out into the soft tissue, which enlarged the circumference of the leg, and that's what we see in this axial view. 00:10:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:10So again, I think the takeaway on the image ion or extension, however, instead of osteonecrosis. 00:03:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:20Soft tissue injuries of the elbow, wrist, and hand. 00:03:24Grade I muscle strain stretches the tissue without disruption. 00:03:29Grade II is a partial tearing of the muscle tissue while sparing the overlying fascia. 00:03:35Grade III is a complete tear of the muscle and fascia resulting in a total loss of motion. 00:03:40[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:44Infection of the elbow, wrist, and hand. 00:03:47Puncture wounds, abrasions, cuts, or other causes of skin disruption increase the likelihood of infection. 00:03:55Fever, chills, a new onset of hand pain, or drainage should all raise your suspicion of an infection. 00:04:03A patient's occupation may increase 10:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:10So again, I think the takeaway on the image on the right is just noting how this bone is reactive here, a little brighter as it tries to wall off that area, and especially in the CT down below here. 00:10:24You can really see that brightness. 00:10:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:31So continuing with our ABCDs, we're on C, which is cartilage spaces. 00:10:35So number 1 under C is joint space, and we want to assess the width of the joint spaces. 00:10:41Is the joint space well-preserved with normal thickness of cartilage, disk, tissue, right? 00:10:46Recall from our last slide, you saw on that degenerative change in the medial joint line, that joint space was not well-preserved. 00:10:54And then ative change in the medial joint line, that joint space was not well-preserved. 00:10:54And then for number 2, if the space is decreased, that's likely the result of degenerative changes. 00:10:59So a well-preserved joint space implies that the cartilage or the disk is of normal thickness. 00:11:05And a decreased joint space implies that the cartilage or disk is thinned down as a result of degenerative processes. 00:11:13[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:17So in this slide on the left is degenerative disk disease. 00:11:21An MRI image of a patient with degenerative disk disease, it shows bands of fatty bone marrow parallel to the L5 disk right here. 00:11:32And so we can see this sort of fattiness, and we can see this degenerated disk here. 00:11:39[BLANK_AUD  of fattiness, and we can see this degenerated disk here. 00:11:39[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:11:48And on the right side, we see degenerative disk disease at the cervical spine. 00:11:53And this lateral view of the cervical spine shows the classic hallmarks of degenerative disk disease at C56, including a narrow joint space, an osteophyte formation at the vertebral end plates. 00:12:05And so you can see these little spurs popping up there, these osteophytes. 00:12:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:14I think the important thing I would take away from these two images are looking at the difference here in the joint spaces here, 00:12:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:25And compare that with this joint space, and it's the same on the other image, right? 00:12: 25And compare that with this joint space, and it's the same on the other image, right? 00:12:29And look here at the joint space, and then we'll compare that with this one. 00:12:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:42Continuing with cartilage spaces, number 2, the subchondral bone. 00:12:47You want to assess the subchondral bone, looking for changes in density or irregularities. 00:12:54And increased sclerosis could be one finding. 00:12:58For example, in osteoarthritis, the subchondral bone becomes increasingly sclerotic as new bone is formed to help withstand the increased stresses directed at it because of the loss of the articular cartilage. 00:13:10So if you recall from a few slides ago, you could see how those brighter areas of bone were created along that medial femur and tibia,  a few slides ago, you could see how those brighter areas of bone were created along that medial femur and tibia, as that joint space became more narrow. 00:13:25Then the other thing to be aware of are erosions. 00:13:28So in rheumatoid arthritis or gout, you see very little reparative sclerosis in the subchondral bone. 00:13:35And instead, you see erosions of the subchondral bone in the form of radiolucencies of the joint margin. 00:13:42And so what that means is that it's very transparent and it's not the right response that we saw with that sclerotic change. 00:13:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:58So in this image, the left hip joint space narrowing reflects the loss of cartilage and changes in bone density and bony irregularities. 00:14:08So oste  space narrowing reflects the loss of cartilage and changes in bone density and bony irregularities. 00:14:08So osteoarthritis is a destructive joint disease that can result in pain, it can result in stiffness, as well as a loss of range of motion or a loss of activity tolerance. 00:14:19And X-rays can confirm the diagnosis of osteoarthritis. 00:14:23So X-rays demonstrate a number of findings in osteoarthritis, although they're not always seen, and they can occur in different variations from individual to individual. 00:14:35So the first thing that we see here is joint space narrowing, and that reflects the loss of cartilage. 00:14:41So we can see the joint space narrowing here, and all through the side when you look at that compared with this joint space. 00:14:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:51The second thing that we can  space. 00:14:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:51The second thing that we can see is sclerosis, which is present in almost all cases of osteoarthritis. 00:14:57And again, sclerosis is that brightness that begins to appear here in reaction to that loss of space and cartilage, right? 00:15:07And look at the amount of brightness there compared to the right big joint. 00:15:14And finally, there's osteophytes present, so a new bone formation around the joint in reaction to that stress. 00:15:21And then subchondral lucency, which is a focal loss of bone density. 00:15:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:15:36Continuing with cartilage spaces, number 3 are the epiphyseal plates. 00:15:40We want to assess the epiphysis, look for changes in the position of seal plates. 00:15:40We want to assess the epiphysis, look for changes in the position of the growth plate or the size of the epiphysis, whether the borders are smooth and whether there's presence of disruption or gaps in the plates. 00:15:54So the position of the growth plate as designated by the relationship of the ossified portion of the secondary epiphysis to the metaphysis. 00:16:03We can see that in figure 221 in your radiology text. 00:16:08And the size of the epiphysis in relation to both the skeletal maturity and the chronological age of the patient has been imaged. 00:16:17Is there's a smooth margin at the borders of the epiphysis, like a band of sclerosis, indicating increased bone activity associated with linear growth? 00:16:27Disruptions in the growth plates from trauma or metabolic disease can be visualized, and those can be :16:27Disruptions in the growth plates from trauma or metabolic disease can be visualized, and those can be difficult to diagnose and they may require contralateral films for comparison. 00:16:37So often, one of the keys in imaging is symmetry, comparing one side to the other side. 00:16:46[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:01:18And so, this is referred to as a triplane fracture, and they tend to occur at the distal tibia. 00:01:24So, on the right is a normal radiographic appearance of a hand of an 8-year old child, and the borders of the epiphyses are normally bounded by a smooth margin with a band of sclerosis indicating increased bone activity. 00:01:38And so, that's fine, that is a really nice one, because you  increased bone activity. 00:01:38And so, that's fine, that is a really nice one, because you can see how great that is right there. 00:01:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:48And this is how they're distinguished from fracture fragments, with that really, really bright band of sclerosis from the increased bone activity, all right? 00:01:58So now, we'll get back to soft tissues from our ABCS. 00:02:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:06So, under soft tissues, number one is muscles, and we can assess the soft tissue of the muscles, looking for changes in muscle girth that might represent muscle wasting or gross swelling of muscle and soft tissues. 00:02:18And so, although tissue densities appear similar on radiographs, because tissue has limited density compared with bone. 00:02:26In extreme circumstances, some properties of the  hand pain, or drainage should all raise your suspicion of an infection. 00:04:03A patient's occupation may increase exposure to certain infectious agents. 00:04:09So occupation such as an animal handler, even someone gardening, washing dishes, or working in a tropical fish store. 00:04:17Immune status affects morbidity from hand infections. 00:04:21So diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or malignancy, all affect morbidity. 00:04:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:29You want to take patient vital signs and expose the entire upper extremity for examination if you suspect an infection. 00:04:36Epitrochlear and axillary lymphadenopathy often accompany a forearm infection. 00:04:41[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:43We mentioned above, occupation, the patient's occupation may increase their exposure to certain infectious agents. 00:04:51An animal  radiographs, because tissue has limited density compared with bone. 00:02:26In extreme circumstances, some properties of the soft tissue can actually be visualized, and gross muscle wasting could suggest a primary muscle disease paralysis, or some sort of severe illness or disuse attribute is secondary to trauma 00:02:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:48Gross swelling for example of muscles and soft tissues could also be indicative of inflammation or edema, hemorrhage, or tumor. 00:02:58So essentially, looking at the size or the girth of the muscle can be indicative of different pathologies. 00:03:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:09So, in this image, we're looking at disuse atrophy of the quadriceps, and this is disuse atrophy of the quadriceps secondary to a traumatic patellar dislocation. 00:03:20And you can see the shrunken  quadriceps secondary to a traumatic patellar dislocation. 00:03:20And you can see the shrunken and concave appearance of the soft tissue outlining the thigh. 00:03:26Look at the inferior position of the patella related to the quadriceps insufficiency, right? 00:03:32And so, here on the other leg, this is the normal patella position. 00:03:38And on the right side, you can see it's really free. 00:03:41You can see how the patella was dropped down there. 00:03:44And also, even more there, and you can see the bulk of the quads here on this one. 00:03:52You can see it's all these. 00:03:55[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:57Okay. 00:03:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:00 ] 00:03:57Okay. 00:03:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:00This is a really excellent drawing. 00:04:01Bob Ross-like drawing, I suppose. 00:04:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:11So, continuing with our soft tissues. 00:04:12Number 2 is fat pads, and we want to assess the fat pads looking for changes in the position of the fat pads. 00:04:20And this is usually a result of swelling and possibly an injury to an adjacent structure. 00:04:25So, although soft tissue densities may appear similar, again, we're looking more at girth or maybe location of soft tissue on one extremity compared to another extremity. 00:04:40[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:44So, in this image, on the left, we're looking at a normal pronator quad ] 00:04:44So, in this image, on the left, we're looking at a normal pronator quadratus fat pad. 00:04:51And on the right, we're looking at anterior bowing of the pronator quadratus fat pad. 00:04:58So, on lateral wrist radiographs, the pronator fat pad usually appears as a thin, radiolucent triangle with its base attached to the palmar surface of the distal radius. 00:05:10And the bowing on the right could be the result of a fall, a muscle strain, an inflammatory condition or infection, or septic arthritis at the wrist, but that bowing is a result of fluid. 00:05:25So, you can see how it kind of bulges out there, as opposed to this side, and it's pretty straight 00:05:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:44So, continuing with  it's pretty straight 00:05:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:44So, continuing with soft tissues, number 3 is joint capsule, we want to assess the joint capsule. 00:05:49Usually you can't see these well, but they become visible when swelling is present. 00:05:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:55And so that swelling is seen and exacerbations of arthritic conditions, like infection or hemophilia, and acute joint trauma. 00:06:05Effusion from the trauma and intra articular fracture may produce a lipohemarthrosis in the joint capsule, and a lipohemarthrosis is the mixture of fat and blood from the marrow, which enters the joint space through an osteochondral defect. 00:06:22And so because fat is less dense than blood, the fat floats on the surface of the blood. 00:06:27On  so because fat is less dense than blood, the fat floats on the surface of the blood. 00:06:27On a radiograph, this is referred to as a fat fluid level or a fat-blood interface, FBI sign fat-blood interface. 00:06:39And somewhat seen on a radiograph it's a sign or a strong indicator for potentially overlooked intra articular fracture. 00:06:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:51So, this is the fat-blood interface sign, the FBI sign, and this is a non-weight-bearing lateral view of the knee, and marrow and blood that seep through the intra-articular tibial patella fracture, which we can't see here. 00:07:08It has accumulated in the suprapatellar area of the joint capsule, and divided into layers because of differences in fluid density. 00:07:17And a fracture has to occur for this sign  and divided into layers because of differences in fluid density. 00:07:17And a fracture has to occur for this sign to be present. 00:07:21[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:25So, I think a couple of important things we need to recognize. 00:07:28Number one, we have the joint space here between the tibia and the femur, and the we have the patella here. 00:07:34And then note the difference in the densities here, you can see the fat and the blood interface. 00:07:41But the other thing I think that's important to recognize is that, if we look at the contour of the skin here. 00:07:49You can see how it's kind of pushed out, and that's a result of the fluid accumulation here, between the blood and the femur. 00:07:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08  here, between the blood and the femur. 00:07:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:01And the soft tissue. 00:08:02[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:11So, continuing with soft tissues, number 4 is periosteum. 00:08:14And the periosteum is assessed for any kind of reactive process, so a solid reaction for fracture healing or osteomyelitis. 00:08:23A laminated process due to repetitive injury, a sunburst as a result of malignancy, or a Codman's triangle due to a tumor, hemorrhage or other trauma. 00:08:34So, normally, rather than distinct, the periosteum can become evident in its response to abnormal conditions. 00:08:41And you can actually see this in your McKenna's textbook, figure 2 dash 26. 00:08:47And a per And you can actually see this in your McKenna's textbook, figure 2 dash 26. 00:08:47And a periosteal reaction is generally described as being one of four types, and by the characteristic radiographic images. 00:08:56So, look for these types of periosteal reaction. 00:08:58A solid Is a reaction that indicates an indolent or slow rolling process which is seen in fracture healing, in chronic osteomyelitis, laminated or onionskin kind of shape or outline, and this reaction indicates repetitive injury. 00:09:18As in battered child syndrome, it's also associated with sarcomas, a sunburst or speculated pattern. 00:09:26So, this reaction is almost always associated with malignant bone lesions such as sarcomas, and is frequently seen in metastatic squamous cell tumors. 00:09:36The distinct appearance of the periosteum is due to the repeated  squamous cell tumors. 00:09:36The distinct appearance of the periosteum is due to the repeated breakthrough of the tumor, the neoplastic process, followed by a new periosteal response. 00:09:48And finally, Codman's triangle, where a piece of the periosteum is elevated by abnormal conditions and it ossifies in a triangular shape. 00:09:56And this can be present in a variety of conditions, including a tumor, a subperiosteal hemorrhage in battered child syndrome. 00:10:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:11And periosteal reactions to abnormal conditions appear on radiograph in four characteristic images, all right? 00:10:18The solid and the sunburst here, and then the onionskin, we have these layers, right? 00:10:28And finally Codman's triangle. 00:10:29So,  mentioned above, occupation, the patient's occupation may increase their exposure to certain infectious agents. 00:04:51An animal handler may be prone to bite wounds that may become infected with organisms typical for involved species. 00:04:57A rose gardener, for example, is at risk for infection through the introduction of spores through a cut or puncture wound in the skin. 00:05:05Certain professions are more prone to chronic paronychia. 00:05:09As an example, dishwashers are likely to develop candida infections, whereas a person employed in a tropical fish aquarium is more likely to develop another kind of infection after a hand injury, mycobacterium. 00:05:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:29And here are two images of infection. 00:05:32On the left is erythema following a catfish sting and a subsequent infection. 00:05:37And we can see  have these layers, right? 00:10:28And finally Codman's triangle. 00:10:29So, the Codman's triangle, it might be helpful to imagine you have your bone here and something kind of pushes that bone out, and continues to push it out like this. 00:10:41[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:43And it develops into a triangle shape. 00:10:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:52So, soft tissue is number 5, miscellaneous soft tissue findings. 00:10:57We assess for out-of-the-ordinary soft tissue findings. 00:11:00So, gas as a result of gangrene or trauma, calcification, or foreign bodies. 00:11:07So, gas in soft tissue is an indication of gas forming organisms such as gangrene or trauma, and calcifications in soft tissues can be the result of cold trauma where a hemorrh  forming organisms such as gangrene or trauma, and calcifications in soft tissues can be the result of cold trauma where a hemorrhage is coagulated and calcified. 00:11:21Calcifications also occur in vessels and organs, for example, renal calculi or gallstones, or calcifications in the abdominal or the organs, those can be seen on radiographs. 00:11:33And finally, things like foreign bodies, such as metal shards, you can also see those on soft tissues on radiographs. 00:11:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:44So in this image, we're looking at myositis, ossificans of the elbow and forearm. 00:11:49This is an AP view of the elbow, and heterotopic bone is developed in the soft tissues of a forearm of this 53-year old man after a biceps tendon tear, and a repair with a Mitek suture anchor  of this 53-year old man after a biceps tendon tear, and a repair with a Mitek suture anchor. 00:12:04So, the boundaries of that abnormal tissue are here. 00:12:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:13Okay, this is the heterotopic bone, and then here, you can see some hardware, right in there. 00:12:25[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:02:55And then it's sharply defined, it's a slow growing lesion. 00:03:02[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:04And then the shape is usually longer than it is wide. 00:03:08And that's sort of what we see here too again, if you look at B, right, this is sort of a long [INAUDIBLE]  we see here too again, if you look at B, right, this is sort of a long [INAUDIBLE] But it can also be broad based triggers for like growth. 00:03:25A really important one here though is that the joint space is usually preserved, right? 00:03:30And so we look here at this femural joint. 00:03:33We still have space in there if we look between the tibia and the femur, we still have space in there, you can see that space here too. 00:03:45And the bony reaction, it's, it's usually encompassed by a cartilage cap. 00:03:51And finally, the matrix production is mixed and there's no soft tissue changes and no history of trauma or surgery. 00:03:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:05So when we think about, again, the radiologic diagnosis of skeletal pathology, we AUDIO] 00:04:05So when we think about, again, the radiologic diagnosis of skeletal pathology, we're looking at number one, identifying the category of the methodology. 00:04:15The different categories include, for example, congenital, right from birth, so the presence of a cervical rib, inflammatory having to do with vascular structure, osteomyelitis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, metabolic, such as Paget's disease or fibrous dryplasia. 00:04:37Aa neoplastic category like a bone tumor, a traumatic category like a broken bone fractured, a vascular category such as avascular necrosis or fever, and then finally a miscellaneous or other, which can include things like an infection or osteoarthritis. 00:04:55[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:00So as we look at the categories, we'll start here with the inflammatory category. 00:05: :05:00So as we look at the categories, we'll start here with the inflammatory category. 00:05:05And what we're looking at in this slide is ankylosing spondylitis. 00:05:10And both of these images are from a 66 year old man on the left, the ossification of the outer fibers of the disc. 00:05:19The amylose fibrosis and the alpophaseal joints have fused, so we can see the ossification of the outer fibers of the disc here, and the other thing that's. 00:05:38Here's a look at this bonding activity here. 00:05:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:44On the right, ligamentous ossifications and you can also see fusion of the apophyseal and sacroiliac joints. 00:05:52Usually, there's more dark appearing cartilage, ophyseal and sacroiliac joints. 00:05:52Usually, there's more dark appearing cartilage, but that's been replaced by bone matrix. 00:05:58You can see that in the red arrow here. 00:06:01And then like your takeaway from the right which is really just the amount of bone that's present, the amount of bright image that's present in this picture. 00:06:11And we can just see 00:06:12[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:16That much of a gap in here or here too, and we don't see a lot of smoothness when you see a lot of [UNKNOWN] Going matrix, 00:06:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:32So the next category we're going to look at is the metabolic category, sample here is nutritional rickets. 00:06:42And so what we're looking at in these  the metabolic category, sample here is nutritional rickets. 00:06:42And so what we're looking at in these images is nutritional rickets and a femoral fracture in a three year old female. 00:06:50So on the left we have AP radiograph of both knees, and we can see a fracture of the distal right femur with a black arrow right here, and if you remember our ABCs. 00:07:02The alignment here is off, so this is not very well aligned. 00:07:11We can also see fractures of the right tibia and both fibula, and that's at the dashed white pearls right down here. 00:07:20And you can see this one down here [INAUDIBLE] We can also see this sort of fragmented or frayed and fractured metaphyses, and that's at the solid white arrows here. 00:07:35So we can see this just doesn't look very  and that's at the solid white arrows here. 00:07:35So we can see this just doesn't look very distinct and solid, it's kind of hanging off to the side here. 00:07:42Same with this one over here. 00:07:45So the image on the right is the same individual two years later. 00:07:50And you can see this sort of diffuse osteopenia, as you can see following the tibia, right here, and you can see following the fibula here. 00:08:03We can also see widened growth plates here, 00:08:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:09And we can see the sclerosis and irregularity on metapasis. 00:08:13The arrows point to the sclerotic metaphysial bands due to alternating periods of adequate and inadequate mineralization. 00:08:23That may be due to or related to the adequacy of  periods of adequate and inadequate mineralization. 00:08:23That may be due to or related to the adequacy of nutrition during certain periods of time versus inadequate nutrition during other periods of time. 00:08:35Again, that sort of white space here, I guess that's for those [INAUDIBLE]. 00:08:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:47So once we've identified the category, now we want to identify the distribution of the lesion and whether it's a monoarticular such as a fracture affecting only one bone or joint. 00:08:59Polyarticular, such as rheumatoid arthritis, which can affect multiple bones or joints, or diffuse, such as osteoporosis or bony metastases, which can affect all or nearly all the bones or joints, like neoplastic and metabolic disease. 00:09:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:20So here's  left is erythema following a catfish sting and a subsequent infection. 00:05:37And we can see here the redness, the area of erythema. 00:05:42And this right here is the puncture wound from the catfish sting. 00:05:46So on the right, this photograph demonstrates a dorsal subcutaneous abscess. 00:05:52Note that the abscess is pointing, meaning that the skin is starting to thin from the pressure of the fluid underneath it. 00:05:59And this indicates an impending rupture of the abscess. 00:06:03So, I can see this, 00:06:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:07Whole area, and this is the pointing of the abscess. 00:06:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:18So this is another image of infection in the elbow, wrist, and hand astic and metabolic disease. 00:09:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:20So here's a diffuse distribution and this is metastases and we can see why spread sclerosis. 00:09:27So again, sclerosis is this increased bone density that increase brightness of the pelvis and the sacroiliac region. 00:09:34And the vertebral bodies of the thoracic and lumbar spine appear of sclerotic with a loss of the pedicles bilaterally. 00:09:50And so you can sort of see, really distinct, whichever bodies looks like there's just nothing attached to them. 00:10:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:05So now we're going to identify some predictor variables that suggest seeing table to dashboard in your McInnes text for some additional information. 00:10:17So the behavior of the lesion, is it osteolytic or osteoblastic or  information. 00:10:17So the behavior of the lesion, is it osteolytic or osteoblastic or next? 00:10:24And so we may see geographic destruction of areas of bone that become destroyed or moth eaten appearance where there are small holes and ragged borders. 00:10:35Or we might see permeative destruction, where there's very fine destruction through the conversion system of the bone. 00:10:42Possibly requiring magnification to see, might suggest a malignant lesion. 00:10:48Is it osteoblastic, where we have reparative or reactive bone formation, or is it mixed? 00:10:55Number two, the bone or joint involved. 00:10:57So some diseases affect certain bones characteristically. 00:11:01Gout and rheumatoid arthritis usually affect the small joints of the hands and feet, while osteoarthritis will affect the knees. 00:11:  usually affect the small joints of the hands and feet, while osteoarthritis will affect the knees. 00:11:09And then the locus within a bone. 00:11:11So certain tumors are going to arise in the diathesis, while others will occur in the physioregion or the metaphysioregion. 00:11:19And osteoarthritis is going to affect the weight-bearing areas, the age, the gender, and the race of the patient. 00:11:28So the age could be a risk factor for certain tumors And gender may be a risk factor for others. 00:11:34Rheumatoid arthritis, for example may affect females more often than males, as yeas will be likely just the opposite where males are affected more often than females. 00:11:45And then the margin of revision explanation was sharply defined or as a poorly defined A. 00:11:51Sharply defined And then the margin of revision explanation was sharply defined or as a poorly defined A. 00:11:51Sharply defined lesion is usually indicative of a slow-growing lesion, while a poorly defined margin of lesion is generally associated with a lesion that's more aggressive. 00:12:01And then the shape of a lesion. 00:12:04So if the shape is longer than wide, it's generally a slow-growing lesion. 00:12:09And if the shape is wider than it is long, it's generally an aggressive. 00:12:15And the joint space, is the joint space crossed, or is the joint space preserved? 00:12:21And tumors don't usually cross the joint space or the growth space. 00:12:24On the other hand, infections and inflammatory processes has instructions on both sides of the choice. 00:12:32And then number eight bony reaction. 00:12:  instructions on both sides of the choice. 00:12:32And then number eight bony reaction. 00:12:35So periosteal reaction is characterized by interrupted for uninterrupted with interrupted suggesting some kind of malignant or aggressive lesion. 00:12:47Uninterrupted usually suggests that benign, usually solid density kind of [UNKNOWN] The presentation of an interrupted pattern could be sunburst onion scan or the [UNKNOWN] as we saw in prior slides. 00:13:05We could also see sclerosis or what's called I want to say we have this exostoses or osteophytes at the billing emergency. 00:13:14Number nine matrix production, and the matrix is the tissue produced by the primary bone and neoplasms. 00:13:22So we can have osteoid where it's bony and it appears white clouds light and fluffy density. 00:13:30Conjoined with more cartilaginous appearing or popcorn life and  white clouds light and fluffy density. 00:13:30Conjoined with more cartilaginous appearing or popcorn life and then we could also have a mixed in soft tissue changes. 00:13:39We could see that edema or haemorrhage or joint effusion displacement of fat pads or fat lines. 00:13:46Remember the s of our ABCs, infections or inflammation, which adds density to the soft tissue. 00:13:55Finally, a history of trauma or surgery number 11. 00:13:59A history of pain related to activity may help differentiate between a stress fracture and a malignant bone tumor. 00:14:06An odd bone impairment could be related to a history of surgery. 00:14:11So, a number of different predictive variables and again, for this I'd suggest referring back to table 2 dash 4, and you are McKenna's text. 00:14:20[BLANK_AUDIO] c  table 2 dash 4, and you are McKenna's text. 00:14:20[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:01:29[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:35So the 4 Ds, radiologists are trained in the 4 Ds of radiology reporting, and they're the basic sequential tests performed when the radiologist reads a case. 00:01:47And the 4 Ds are to detect, describe, diagnose, or differential diagnosis, and make a decision. 00:01:54[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:59So the first D is detect. 00:02:00The first thing a radiologist needs to do, and it's much improved with information in the referral about the patient's history and examination findings, associated signs, etc. 00:02:11So this is the first task of the  patient's history and examination findings, associated signs, etc. 00:02:11So this is the first task of the radiologist. 00:02:14And again, knowledge of associated signs and pathologies is essential for the radiologist to make the report more accurate. 00:02:23And so what the radiologist detects is going to be included in the findings section of the report. 00:02:29[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:35And then the second thing is describe, and so the findings are described clearly and concisely using medical terminology. 00:02:44It's written for the radiologist so that another radiologist can come to the same conclusion based only on the description. 00:02:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:56The third D is diagnosis or differential diagnosis, and that's the heart of the report and the answer to the clinical question that the referring provider is asking the radiologist.  and that's the heart of the report and the answer to the clinical question that the referring provider is asking the radiologist. 00:03:06So differentials are ordered in the most likely sequence with a maximum of 3 differentials usually. 00:03:13And again, this is the heart of the report and it's really designed to answer the clinical question. 00:03:21[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:24And finally, the fourth D is the decision, what to do next. 00:03:27Is it important to inform others, and if so, how urgently and who to inform? 00:03:33And is immediate communication required? 00:03:35Are further tests recommended? 00:03:38Are the instructions no further testing necessary appropriate for this particular case? 00:03:43[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:53So this is an example radiology report. 00:03:56 BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:53So this is an example radiology report. 00:03:56In addition to a tool for healthcare providers, radiology reports can enable patients to learn about their health, right? 00:04:03Patients can obtain copies of their reports through an electronic portal or even a paper copy. 00:04:08The report should be designed to increase the patient's understanding. 00:04:13So at the top we see technique, and that's right here. 00:04:18[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:27And technique provides information about what was imaged and the type of imaging modality that was used and the information about a contrast agent, if one was present, and last one here. 00:04:40[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:43The comparison in this example indicates that no prior imaging is on record to compare the study with [INAUDIBLE ANK_AUDIO] 00:06:18So this is another image of infection in the elbow, wrist, and hand. 00:06:25And this is an example of skin necrosis with MRSA infection. 00:06:29[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:38Infection, diagnosing most hand infections. 00:06:41The majority of hand infections can be diagnosed on clinical examination based on the presence of pain, erythema, abnormal swelling, or drainage. 00:06:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:55Raynaud's disease or Raynaud's phenomenon. 00:06:58This is an exaggerated vascular response to cold or emotional stress. 00:07:03Note color changes of the skin and fingers. 00:07:07Raynaud's can be secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis. 00:07:13It's 04:43The comparison in this example indicates that no prior imaging is on record to compare the study with [INAUDIBLE] here. 00:04:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:52The findings are where you're going to find descriptions of the areas examined by the radiologist, along with descriptions of abnormalities or normal appearance. 00:05:02Findings may be grouped by paragraphs into the ABCs, and so the findings are right here. 00:05:08And in this case, we have mild straightening of the lumbar spine, likely due to muscular spasm. 00:05:14Otherwise, the alignment is maintained. 00:05:17No evidence of acute or chronic fracture, and conus medullaris and cauda equina nerve roots are unremarkable. 00:05:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:27And, 00:05:28[BLANK_AUDIO] BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:27And, 00:05:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:31Finally, we have the conclusion at the bottom. 00:05:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:36And the conclusion is the area where the findings are summarized. 00:05:39And it's also where the radiologist labels the condition and may make a diagnosis. 00:05:44If there are multiple diagnoses, they're reported in the order of severity, starting with the most serious diagnosis. 00:05:52So in this case, we have multilevel degenerative disk disease as detailed above, for clinical correlation. 00:05:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:09So radiology reports are intended for physician use, but patients may benefit from a more readable and understandable design, or someone to help them interpret the findings. 00:06:19And so  benefit from a more readable and understandable design, or someone to help them interpret the findings. 00:06:19And so I've included this slide here, and this is from a study that demonstrates a more patient-friendly kind of approach to radiology reports. 00:06:28So in this study, patients were much more satisfied when the results were made more understandable and medical terminology was explained. 00:06:37Especially when the patients are able to link the locations on the imaging to the imaging text content and their current complaints. 00:06:47By helping patients better understand the content of their results, the patients have a greater understanding of their condition and the rationale for interventions, and their satisfaction with the entire outcome is usually much higher. 00:07:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:06And I apologize for some of the missing text up here. 00:07:09But one of the things to notice here is these pieces here that are  the missing text up here. 00:07:09But one of the things to notice here is these pieces here that are underlined, for example, hypertrophy here at the L4-L5 in the image. 00:07:20This text here refers to hypertrophy, and the patient can then go over here to hypertrophy and see that hypertrophy means the enlargement of the cells. 00:07:30Over here, down below you see disc protrusion. 00:07:34The patient can come over here and look at disc protrusion, and you can see that the spine is intact, but bulge when one or more of this are under pressure. 00:07:44[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:51So this slide has a lot of text, but I included it to remind you that errors do occur in diagnostic radiology. 00:07:58And this is the most widely accepted classification system and  you that errors do occur in diagnostic radiology. 00:07:58And this is the most widely accepted classification system and the Renfrew classification system. 00:08:05And so there are at least 12 types of errors that occur in diagnostic radiology. 00:08:12Some include, for example, number 10 here, type 10, failure to find a subsequent abnormality after the initial abnormality was detected. 00:08:19And we touched on this earlier, this is failure to note the second fracture. 00:08:25And so they find the first fracture and stop looking. 00:08:29Other ones that I think that are kind of interesting here, type 5, poor communication. 00:08:34So the radiologist identifies a finding is abnormal, but that finding or that information is poorly communicated to the relevant permission, such as the physical therapist, and so that abnormal finding is not appreciated by the therapist. 00:08:53[ , such as the physical therapist, and so that abnormal finding is not appreciated by the therapist. 00:08:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:55So Brook proposed the following classification as an alternative to the Renfrew classification, and this takes more than just human error into account. 00:09:06So the Brook classification starts with latent errors. 00:09:10We have an in-built system or technical faults that predispose to errors in interpretation of images. 00:09:17And then we have active failures or human error, such as diagnostic errors and misinterpretation, or complications from procedures, and they can involve more than one person or be secondary to latent errors. 00:09:32Then we have external causes which are beyond the control of the radiologist, such as a power failure. 00:09:37And then customer causes which are related to the patient and non-radiology staff. 00:09:42So complying 37And then customer causes which are related to the patient and non-radiology staff. 00:09:42So complying with instructions or unfamiliarity with the procedure, resulting in poor imaging outcomes. 00:09:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:55Another classification system is the Brook classification. 00:10:01And this is an alternative to the Renfrew classification, and it takes more than just human error into account. 00:10:08And so, for example, we have the latent errors, which are in-built system and technical faults that predispose to errors. 00:10:16Then we have active failures or human error, such as diagnostic errors and misinterpretation, or complications from procedures, usually injections. 00:10:27And then they can involve more than one person or be secondary to latent or built-in errors. 00:10:32And then we have external causes that are beyond the control of the radiologist  built-in errors. 00:10:32And then we have external causes that are beyond the control of the radiologist, such as a power failure. 00:10:37And finally, customer causes or patient causes. 00:10:43It's related to non-radiology staff or patients, and they can include things like not complying with instructions or simply being unfamiliar with the procedure. 00:10:52And so that wraps up this lecture, and, 00:10:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:01I'd remind you to go back and take a look at those 4 Ds, and also, have a pretty basic idea of what's included in a radiology report. 00:11:09[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:01:24And it may also include an AP of the pelvis to assess for fractures ielo24.com00:01:24And it may also include an AP of the pelvis to assess for fractures or hemorrhage. 00:01:29So the primary trauma survey is a series of images to assist with screening and prioritizing patients multiple injuries. 00:01:37The goal is to avoid subjecting a trauma patient to multiple radiographic examinations and instead to quickly screen them for life-threatening injuries. 00:01:47Usually with a CT scan because the CT in the emergency department decreases assessment time and it also decreases the chance of missing a fracture. 00:01:56And it helps prioritize treatment of the patient. 00:01:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:03Now, some fractures can cause serious complications. 00:02:06So those are fractures which can cause a hemorrhage such as the fracture of a pelvis or the femur. 00:02:13Or fractures which can cause a fat embol  the fracture of a pelvis or the femur. 00:02:13Or fractures which can cause a fat embolism, which is a multiple crushing type injury. 00:02:18Fractures which cause neurovascular damage, which is fractures to the spine, or the elbow, or the proximal humerus. 00:02:25So although orthopedic conditions are not usually the priority in a major trauma case. 00:02:31If there are some conditions that by themselves require urgent action to prevent serious complications. 00:02:37Fractures that can cause hemorrhage, fat embolism, or neurovascular damage, or immediate treatment. 00:02:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:48What is a fracture? 00:02:50A fracture is a break in the structural continuity of bone or cartilage. 00:02:54In the radiology report, fractures are described using anatomic 04:32Knowledge of potential pain location patterns associated with viscera can guide the PT and selecting the organ systems to screen further with questions related to a review of symptoms. 00:04:44Symptom onset, so information about when the symptoms began should be obtained. 00:04:51And is this the episode that started everything? 00:04:55Is there a multi year history? 00:04:57Can the patient point to a specific inciting event? 00:05:00So many patients cannot relate the onset of their symptoms to any particular incident or accident. 00:05:07However, if you question them carefully, you can often uncover a likely cause, such as the patient beginning to run after not having run for three months, or being promoted to some kind of position that requires sitting at a desk for eight hours a day. 00:05:21Or starting to return to gardening, or yard work after the winter. 00:05:26  can be secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis. 00:07:13It's more common among young females and in families with a history of Raynaud's. 00:07:18[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:23Raynaud's diagnostic criteria, there are no simple tests or diagnostic criteria that can be used to diagnose Raynaud's. 00:07:30The following questions, however, may be helpful. 00:07:33Asking your patient, are your fingers unusually sensitive to cold? 00:07:38Do your fingers change color when exposed to cold? 00:07:42If the fingers change color, do they turn white, blue/purple, or both? 00:07:47[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:51So this is a flowchart of diagnosis of Raynaud's, and it starts with asking, has a typical episode of Ray  structural continuity of bone or cartilage. 00:02:54In the radiology report, fractures are described using anatomic and standardized terms. 00:03:00So eponyms such as Colles fracture or as we mentioned in one of our earlier lectures, that boxer's fracture may be used in some communications. 00:03:09But generally, these eponyms are avoided in radiologic description, because they're not descriptive enough and they can be misinterpreted. 00:03:18So here's a fractured ulna in the AP view, and you can see that here. 00:03:25[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:03:27And usually this fracture is due to a blow to the forearm. 00:03:30Now the image on the right is a lateral view and that reveals the head of the radius. 00:03:40Lets's see that here, and the head of the radius is displaced. 00:03:43A 03:40Lets's see that here, and the head of the radius is displaced. 00:03:43A failure to recognize this abnormality can result in death of the radial head with subsequent elbow dysfunction. 00:03:51This illustrates the importance of always, always obtaining two views of a bone in an injury. 00:03:56[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:02So closed versus open fracture. 00:04:06So a fracture, as we said, is a break in the structural continuity of bone or cartilage. 00:04:10A closed fracture, the skin and the tissue overlying the fracture are intact. 00:04:17And in an open fracture, the skin is perforated or broken, so regardless of the size of the wound. 00:04:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:25Okay, we have that this is open fracture. 00:04:28So a AUDIO] 00:04:25Okay, we have that this is open fracture. 00:04:28So a basic clinical distinction in defining fractures is whether or not the fracture site is exposed to the external environment. 00:04:36In the past, the term simple and compound were used because the terms weren't used reliably simple and compound are no longer used, and diagnostic coding terminology. 00:04:46And they've been replaced with closed and open fracture. 00:04:49[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:03:02The bottom is a fracture of the distal femur, but this fracture does not involve the joint space and is therefore considered extra-articular. 00:03:11The fracture line is above the condyles. 00:03:14And so here we see this fracture. 00:03:16[BLANK_  condyles. 00:03:14And so here we see this fracture. 00:03:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:21Right, and so we can also see here that the alignment, 00:03:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:26Is just off a little bit. 00:03:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:35So the second element of fractures, here we have the type of fracture. 00:03:41And on the left, we can see a complete fracture, and on the right is an incomplete fracture. 00:03:47So I think the takeaways here are, in a complete fracture, one bone has become two fracture fragments, right, 1, 2. 00:03:58Now, if the bone becomes more than two fragments, then the fracture is considered comminuted. 00:04:04While in an incomplete fracture, one cortical margin  fragments, then the fracture is considered comminuted. 00:04:04While in an incomplete fracture, one cortical margin remains intact, and we still have one bone because only one portion of the cortex was disrupted. 00:04:14So on the right side here, we can see that this remains intact, while this side here is disrupted. 00:04:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:26So incomplete fractures are relatively stable, and they may maintain their position if stresses placed on them are minimized. 00:04:34So usually, incomplete fractures occur in short bones, also in irregular-shaped bones and flat bones. 00:04:40[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:48So in this image, we're looking at a complete fracture of the distal radius and an incomplete fracture of the distal ulna, okay? 00:04:56And so the distal radius here, you can see one part is al ulna, okay? 00:04:56And so the distal radius here, you can see one part is here and the other part is there. 00:05:06That's a complete fracture. 00:05:08And the ulna, we have an incomplete fracture, because look at this cortical margin, it's still intact whereas on this side, it is not intact. 00:05:21So this is a complete transverse fracture of the distal right radial metadiaphysis, with posterolateral displacement by one shaft width. 00:05:32So you can see here this, 00:05:35[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:37And shift it over by about the width of the shaft. 00:05:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:44And then there's an associated buckle fracture of the distal ulna, the slight radial angulation. 00:05:50And  there's an associated buckle fracture of the distal ulna, the slight radial angulation. 00:05:50And so that's right here, this is the buckle fracture, and you can see how the ulna sort of buckled over that way. 00:05:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:01The distal radioulnar joint alignment appears preserved, and so that's right here. 00:06:07Well, that's a mess down there, but I think you get the idea 00:06:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:19So 7 elements of a fracture, number 3 is the alignment of the fracture fragments. 00:06:27And so over here in A, we have nondisplaced. 00:06:32We have a medial displacement. 00:06:35We have a lateral displacement going this way. 00:06:38We have distracted. 00:06:42 :35We have a lateral displacement going this way. 00:06:38We have distracted. 00:06:42We have overriding and posterior superior displacement down here, and we have distracted and rotated. 00:06:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:54So alignment position is described based on the position of the distal fragment in relation to the proximal fragment. 00:07:02So non-displaced fractures have some degree of contact between the fracture fragments versus displaced fractures. 00:07:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:18So in these images, we're looking at complete fractures of the right radius and the ulna, and we have one shaft width of ulnar and dorsal superior displacement, and there's also 90 degrees of rotation of both fractures. 00:07:33And so the distal segment describes the alignment of the fracture, right? 00:07:37And so this is the distal  the distal segment describes the alignment of the fracture, right? 00:07:37And so this is the distal segment, and the distal fragment of ulna and radius have moved in the ulna direction. 00:07:44It may have also migrated superiorly. 00:07:49So there's one shaft width of ulna and volar displacement of the radial fracture, right? 00:07:55So that's the end of this one. 00:07:58And there's 90 degrees of rotation of both fractures. 00:08:02So the elbow and the elbow, we can imagine that this is going straight into the image, right, straight backwards going that way. 00:08:14The elbow and the wrist joints are oriented perpendicular to each other in this case, right? 00:08:18So if this is going straight into the page right here this is going along that way. 00:08:25So they are perpendicular  this is going straight into the page right here this is going along that way. 00:08:25So they are perpendicular to each other in this case. 00:08:29Now, this image on the right here, that's plate and screw fixation two months later, right, so we can see the hardware. 00:08:35And a few lectures ago, we talked about how you can see, even when you remove the hardware, you'll still be able to see some changes in the bone once that hardware is removed. 00:08:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:53So in the seven elements of fracture description number four, the direction of the fracture lines. 00:09:00And these are described in reference to the longitudinal axis of a long bone. 00:09:05So we have transverse here and longitudinal here and oblique here, sort of, and then spiral here, which is that. 00:09:20  this is a flowchart of diagnosis of Raynaud's, and it starts with asking, has a typical episode of Raynaud's phenomenon been witnessed by a clinician or shown to the clinician in photographs or a video? 00:08:04A typical episode of Raynaud is characterized by the following. 00:08:07A sudden onset of cold fingers or toes, an association with sharply demarcated color changes of skin color, followed by cyanotic skin, so a white attack followed by a blue attack. 00:08:19With re-warming ischemic phase, wider blue attack usually last 15 to 20 minutes. 00:08:26The skin subsequently blushes and turns red or pink upon recovery. 00:08:31So, if this has occurred, you want to evaluate for possible secondary causes of Raynaud's phenomenon. 00:08:39If it has not occurred, then you want to ask the patient the following questions, and  and longitudinal here and oblique here, sort of, and then spiral here, which is that. 00:09:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:22So the transverse is usually a result of a bending force, and it occurs at a right angle to the longitudinal axis. 00:09:30And so you have a force, for example, directed this way. 00:09:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:39Then a longitudinal, that force is generally parallel to the shaft of the bone. 00:09:46And the oblique, it's a diagonally oriented fracture and the result of combined compression bending and rotation. 00:09:56So you have a whole bunch of things going on in the oblique, right? 00:10:00So you have again, you have this compression. 00:10:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:06And you have the  have this compression. 00:10:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:06And you have the bending, which is probably taking place, for example that. 00:10:13And you have some sort of rotational force. 00:10:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:21And finally, in spiral you have a fracture that spirals around the long axis due to a rotational force. 00:10:28So spiral and oblique can appear similar but spiral fractures have a vertical segment and sharp jagged edges. 00:10:35Spiral fractures heal more easily than oblique fractures because the fragments fit together and when they do, there's greater stability and they heal more quickly. 00:10:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:53So, in this image, we're looking at, on the left, an oblique fracture at the mid-diaphysis of the t  image, we're looking at, on the left, an oblique fracture at the mid-diaphysis of the tibia, right here. 00:11:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:03And then, on the right, we're looking at a spiral fracture displaced an overlapping of the mid-femoral shaft on the right. 00:11:11So we can see here is one segment [INAUDIBLE] of the other segment. 00:11:21And so oblique fractures generally occur on a plane that's oblique to the long axis of the bone. 00:11:27And these are prone to angulation and you can see that any of the angulation and where the distal portion of the bone points off in a different direction. 00:11:38And note the sharp edges on the spiral fracture, okay, that's really sharp, and how they might fit together more easily. 00:11:48  the spiral fracture, okay, that's really sharp, and how they might fit together more easily. 00:11:48The spiral fractures are also usually the result of a high energy trauma, and often they're associated with displacement. 00:11:55[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:02So continuing with the direction of fracture lines, we have comminuted fractures. 00:12:07We can see these different versions of comminuted fractures. 00:12:13They're fractures with more than two fragments. 00:12:15And so some commonly occurring comminuted fracture patterns are on the far left. 00:12:21This is a wedge shaped or butterfly pattern in the center here, B, we have a two or three segmented level fracture, right? 00:12:29One, two, three, four. 00:12:33[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:35And then other fractures can , four. 00:12:33[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:35And then other fractures can occur with multiple fragments, be it several or several hundred, and they're still described as comminuted. 00:12:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:50So this slide demonstrates comminated fractures with a proximal tibia and patella. 00:12:55So we can see here an A, this is an AP radiograph of the knee and we can see fractures at the proximal tibia and patella. 00:13:03So we can see fracture fragments here, anocracy fractured by patela, all right,? 00:13:11And B we have an axial CT demonstrating fractures of the patella and the posterolateral femoral condyle. 00:13:20So we can see these fractures here, and the patella we can see multiple fractures here.  00:13:20So we can see these fractures here, and the patella we can see multiple fractures here. 00:13:28And then finally at C we can look at this axial CT which shows comminated fractures of a proximal tibia. 00:13:36And again, we can see all these little fractures here. 00:13:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:44So the comminuted fractures are usually the result of extremely high energy loads, and these include crushing forces from motor vehicle accidents. 00:13:53Overall, though, in a nutshell, I think what you should take away is that a comminated fracture describes any fracture that involves more than two fragments. 00:14:02[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:05So the presence of special features number five, on the left, we have impaction. 00:14:12[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:  five, on the left, we have impaction. 00:14:12[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:16And on the right we have avulsion. 00:14:19[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:21And we can see in this MRI image here, this is impaction where this vertebral body has been smooshed. 00:14:32So, the special features of fractures include impaction, which is seen in A and that's a compression fracture of the vertebral body. 00:14:41And that's the result of forces related to axial loading when a bone is driven into itself. 00:14:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:49The other example is B which is an avulsion. 00:14:53And that's seen in this image where medial malleolar of motion occurred due to the result of an e-version force trauma at the ankle.  this image where medial malleolar of motion occurred due to the result of an e-version force trauma at the ankle. 00:15:05And it's usually the result of tensile loading of the bone at the attachment site of a tendon ligaments, it's occurring right here. 00:15:14With the compression forces, the common areas are generally vertebral bodies here, but the other place it can occur is when we imagine the femur and, 00:15:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:15:30The tibia. 00:15:31[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:15:33And when the femur is driven down into the tibia, you can have, again an impaction fracture right there, along the tibial plateau. 00:15:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:15:50And so continuing with the presence of special features on the right here we are seeing an av IO] 00:15:50And so continuing with the presence of special features on the right here we are seeing an avulsion. 00:15:56And this is the lateral view of a foot that's an avulsion fracture of the calcaneal tuberosity. 00:16:02And the avulsed fragment has migrated superiorly because the now unattached tendon has recoiled, pulling that fragment with it. 00:16:11And the dotted lines indicate the normal contact areas of the fragment to the main body of the bone. 00:16:17So this attaches here, and this attaches here, and it should fit in there like a nice little puzzle piece, but it's been torn away by the tendon that attaches right there. 00:16:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:16:40So number six, associated abnormalities, subluxations and dislocations of related joints are probably the most common injuries of soft tissue associated with fracture  associated abnormalities, subluxations and dislocations of related joints are probably the most common injuries of soft tissue associated with fracture. 00:16:52So involvement in nearby soft tissues is also common, such as disruption of the joint capsules and the ligaments and the interosseous membrane between the long bones of the forearm or the tibial fibular syndesmosis. 00:17:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:17:12So here's an example of the associated abnormalities, and this is a posterior elbow dislocation. 00:17:19And so the posterior dislocation of the elbow occurred in this 39 year old man who injured his elbow falling from a skateboard. 00:17:28And A here is a lateral view of the elbow before reduction. 00:17:33And that demonstrates the posterior position of the radius and ulna in relationship with the distal humerus, right? 00:17:40So here's the  phenomenon. 00:08:39If it has not occurred, then you want to ask the patient the following questions, and those are what we mentioned above. 00:08:45Are your fingers unusually sensitive to cold? 00:08:48Do your fingers change color when exposed to cold? 00:08:50If your fingers change color, do they turn white, blue, or both? 00:08:56So fingers are unusually sensitive to cold, but not associated with color changes, that's unlikely Raynaud's phenomenon. 00:09:02If fingers change color when exposed to cold, that's possible Raynaud's phenomenon, if the changes are uniphasic. 00:09:11If the fingers change color when exposed to cold and the changes are biphasic, then we can presume it's Raynaud's, and we evaluate for secondary causes of Raynaud's. 00:09:22So it's a very complex flowchart  radius and ulna in relationship with the distal humerus, right? 00:17:40So here's the ulna and the radius, and they should be up this way. 00:17:48You can also see the fractured fragment over here. 00:17:51[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:17:53Now in B here and C, we can see that the fracture has been reduced and we see now better positioning of the joints, and we also see multiple fracture fragments in the soft tissue. 00:18:08And that's what these arrows are here, right? 00:18:11So fracture fragments here and down here. 00:18:15And also note the swelling of the joint and that's seen best on the lateral view because of the acute trauma. 00:18:22So that's [INAUDIBLE], and you can see how fluffy that is. 00:18:27[BLANK_AUDIO] INAUDIBLE], and you can see how fluffy that is. 00:18:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:18:37So number 7, special types of fractures resulting from abnormal stress or pathological processes in the bones, such as stress fractures or pathological fractures. 00:18:48So stress fractures appear as a regular localized areas of more radio dense area and they represent the bones ongoing attempts at repair, right? 00:18:59So we see increased bone activity and so the image appears brighter in that area. 00:19:03The initial radiographs often appear normal, making that diagnosis difficult so there may not be evidence, for example, of a fracture line or periosteal reaction for up to six weeks. 00:19:14So we can imagine, for example, someone with a bone stress injury and they're complaining of discomfort, but we see nothing on imaging until maybe six weeks after the onset. 00:19:25And pathological fractures  of discomfort, but we see nothing on imaging until maybe six weeks after the onset. 00:19:25And pathological fractures occur in bone that has been structurally weakened by some sort of pathological process. 00:19:34So that could be a result of osteoporosis or Paget's disease or osteogenesis imperfecta, tumor infections, disuse, etc. 00:19:41Periprosthetic fractures can also occur interoperatively or around the prosthetic components even years after surgery. 00:19:50Bone graft fractures can also occur spontaneously, even two to three years after implantation, and that may not even be related to trauma. 00:19:58The occurrence of those fractures could be as high as 40%, and this increases exponentially in plate patients with plate fixation hardware or patients who are undergoing chemotherapy. 00:20:10[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:20:19So here we're looking at a stress fracture and on the left is BLANK_AUDIO] 00:20:19So here we're looking at a stress fracture and on the left is the calcaneus of a runner. 00:20:25And we can see the small lucency in the posterior superior calcaneal cortex. 00:20:30And this calcaneus is actually a common location of stress fracture. 00:20:34In this case, the patient had a history of overuse, having started running long distances regularly. 00:20:41And you can see that here, so we notice a break in the continuity of the cortex of this calcaneus right here. 00:20:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:20:53And then on the other side on the right, there's a transverse fracture of the radial shaft near the junction of the proximal and mid-thirds, so we can see that right here. 00:21:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00  mid-thirds, so we can see that right here. 00:21:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:21:08And significant cortical thickening is seen throughout the shaft of the radius. 00:21:12And that's probably in response to the kind of training that the cheerleader's doing. 00:21:16So the stress fracture of the radial shaft in a cheerleader, this one is related to repeated full weight bearing on the hand during acrobatics or during training and performing. 00:21:26So the adaptive cortical thickening, or I should say the cortical thickening is an adaptive response to the load that's been placed through the radial shaft. 00:21:37And so that thickening here, and we can see how white, And how wide that white band is, that cortical thickening, and that predates the fracture. 00:21:51And so that cortical thickening is the bone's response to that repeated  that predates the fracture. 00:21:51And so that cortical thickening is the bone's response to that repeated stress and that occurs with training for cheerleading. 00:22:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:22:09Okay, so in this set of two images, we're looking at stress fractures. 00:22:13And on the left is a femoral neck stress fracture in a novice runner and on the right is a severe femoral neck stress fracture and a jogger. 00:22:26On the left, we have this area of sporadic bone, this sort of white bone here, very active bone turnover, and that's seen at the base of the femoral neck. 00:22:39This is a new runner with hip pain, so that finding is generally diagnostic of a stress fracture of the femur. 00:22:48And then on the right side, we see an area of lucency, right, a ur. 00:22:48And then on the right side, we see an area of lucency, right, a darker area. 00:22:54That's right here, that's where we see that darkness. 00:22:58Right, and that's surrounded by this sclerotic bone here. 00:23:05And this is a jogger with hip pain and this is a severe femoral neck stress fracture on the right. 00:23:12So I'll go ahead and erase that so you can see it better again here. 00:23:17And again, what I'd like you to take away from this is just noting this sclerotic area here, right? 00:23:26That bone is very active responding to that fracture. 00:23:30And on the left where not only do we see that sclerotic area, but we also see that linear lucency, that darker area here, this is a more severe  that sclerotic area, but we also see that linear lucency, that darker area here, this is a more severe stress fracture. 00:23:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:23:46Now this is an image of a pathological fracture, osteogenesis imperfecta. 00:23:52And this is a pathological fracture through the distal third of the olecranon in a 26 year old man as you can see by the arrows right here. 00:24:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:24:03And the underlying pathology here is osteogenesis imperfecta. 00:24:07And that's a disease that's characterized by abnormal maturation of collagen affecting both the intramembranous and endochondral bone formation. 00:24:18So note the diffuse decrease in bone density. 00:24:23The very thin cortices and the flared metastases and a cystic appearance of their proximal . 00:24:23The very thin cortices and the flared metastases and a cystic appearance of their proximal ends of the radius of ulna. 00:24:32All right, so we can see this kind of mushroomy appearance here of the radius and maybe of ulna a little bit too, but we can also see how easy it is to see through this bone 00:24:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:24:55Right, just a decrease in bone density throughout here. 00:24:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:25:05Really a tragic disease. 00:25:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:25:12So, in these two images, we're looking again at pathological fracture, but these images represent the fracture as a result of metastases. 00:25:22And so these represent a pathological fracture of the femoral neck. 00:25:26And so in :25:22And so these represent a pathological fracture of the femoral neck. 00:25:26And so in the image on the left A here, this is a bone scan. 00:25:31And this image reveals metastatic lesions caused by breast cancer. 00:25:38So increased uptake of the tracer is normally seen at the injection site right here, right where they inject the tracer, and also at the bladder here. 00:25:47Because that tracer is going to be excreted, but the other dark spot, it's abnormal. 00:25:53And that represents an increased uptake of the tracer by cancerous lesion. 00:25:57And that's right here. 00:25:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:26:01Okay. 00:26:02[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:26:11And so the tumor at the proximal femur weakens  and we evaluate for secondary causes of Raynaud's. 00:09:22So it's a very complex flowchart, 00:09:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:26I don't expect you to memorize all this. 00:09:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:30So this is a picture of a typical episode of Raynaud's. 00:09:34And on the left, we see that pallor in several fingers. 00:09:38And on the right, we see the cyanosis at the fingertips 00:09:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:50Complex regional pain syndrome, CRPS. 00:09:53CRPS is a disorder, usually affecting the distal limbs and is characterized by pain, swelling, limited motion, vasomotor instability, skin changes, and patchy bone demineralization. 00:10:08The 02[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:26:11And so the tumor at the proximal femur weakens the bone, and as a result of that weakening, the bone is fractured here, right? 00:26:21[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:26:29And so, here we're looking at a periprosthetic fracture and on the left side, we're looking at a distal femur with the component intact. 00:26:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:26:41And, 00:26:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:26:44On the right side, we can see, 00:26:47[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:26:50There's that fracture. 00:26:51And we can see a little bit on the left, right? 00:26:56The component is still intact, but we can see that fracture present there.  the left, right? 00:26:56The component is still intact, but we can see that fracture present there. 00:27:00[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:01:19So the preformed cartilage is not imaged. 00:01:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:26So elements of fracture description in addition to the 7 criteria that we talked about earlier. 00:01:34Number 8 in children are patterns of incomplete shaft fractures. 00:01:39And number 9, which occur in children are features of fractures of the epiphysis and the epiphyseal plate. 00:01:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:50So these are patterns of incomplete fractures in children. 00:01:56So first on the left, a green stick fracture. 00:01  of incomplete fractures in children. 00:01:56So first on the left, a green stick fracture. 00:01:59And this depicts the appearance of the incomplete fracture here. 00:02:04And the shaft is fractured on the tension side over here whereas the cortex and the periosteum remain intact on the compression side over here. 00:02:19So next in the middle, we have the torus fracture. 00:02:24And this term is also common and describes an impaction fracture that results in the buckling of the cortex. 00:02:32So you can see this buckling here. 00:02:35The occurs predominantly at the metaphyseal regions, which are predisposed to a compressive response because of the amount of cancellous bone and newly remodeled trabecular bone present. 00:02:48Occasionally this kind of fracture is seen in adults if an underlying pathology exists. 00:  present. 00:02:48Occasionally this kind of fracture is seen in adults if an underlying pathology exists. 00:02:55So again, in the torus, fraction of what we're looking for is this sort of buckling right in here. 00:03:01So plastic bowling on the far right. 00:03:04And this is the result of the unique biomechanical nature of developing bone. 00:03:09So when longitudinal compression forces are imposed on a naturally curved tubular growing bone. 00:03:17And those forces exceed the point in which the bone returns to its prior position. 00:03:23That bone becomes plastically deformed or bowed. 00:03:27And so we've seen a few images in prior lectures where we see this sort of bowing occurring. 00:03:33One in particular where we saw it in both the femur and the tibia of a young patient. 00:03: One in particular where we saw it in both the femur and the tibia of a young patient. 00:03:39And so plastic bowing means that even when the force is removed, the bone remains bowed. 00:03:46So plastic bowing is a type of incomplete fracture because microscopic fatigue lines or microfractures are still evident in this plastically deformed bone. 00:03:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:00So, features of fractures of the epiphysis and epiphyseal plate. 00:04:05And these are Salter-Harris classification of physio fractures. 00:04:13And so, here's a mnemonic, Salter. 00:04:15And so, type I is straight across. 00:04:20Type II is above, right? 00:04:22So if we look at the green line. 00:04:24[BLANK_  right? 00:04:22So if we look at the green line. 00:04:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:26Type II is A, and that's above type III. 00:04:29So SAL number 3 is lower or below, and you can see how it crosses through and goes below that green line. 00:04:40And Type IV is two or through, which means it goes all the way from above, down, and through. 00:04:49And then type V is erasure of the growth plate or a crush. 00:04:54And so now that growth plate is gone. 00:04:59So these Salter-Harris physio fractures, so these account for 15 to 20% of all pediatric fractures and treatment is based on an accurate diagnosis. 00:05:10And that diagnosis is critical because in addition to healing, the goal is to avoid disrupting subsequent growth. 00:05 :10And that diagnosis is critical because in addition to healing, the goal is to avoid disrupting subsequent growth. 00:05:18So the Salter-Harris classification is used to identify the different varieties of epiphyseal fractures. 00:05:25And so again, number one is S and that's a straight across type I and 5% of fractures are type I. 00:05:35The type two is the above and 75% of all fractures are the above type, 75%. 00:05:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:48Type III is L the lower and 10% of fractures are type III. 00:05:54So when we think about type III, we're thinking about below that green line, below that growth plate. 00:06:02And then type IV is 2 or 3 or transverse. 00:06:05And again, 10% of these fractures are type 4, and 5 is where  or transverse. 00:06:05And again, 10% of these fractures are type 4, and 5 is where that growth plate is completely crushed. 00:06:11And that's a fairly uncommon fracture occurring in 5% or less. 00:06:16Generally, the higher the classification the greater the risk of complications and the worse the prognosis is for the patient. 00:06:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:31So in this image, again, we're looking at features of fractures of the epiphysis and epiphyseal plate. 00:06:38And so here we're looking at this distal tibia and we have a Salter-Harris type II fracture. 00:06:45And the fracture extends through the growth plate and exits through the metaphysis. 00:06:51And this creates this triangular wedge of metaphysis that's displaced with the epiphysis. 00:06:56 :51And this creates this triangular wedge of metaphysis that's displaced with the epiphysis. 00:06:56And so we can see. 00:06:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:00All the way down and over, and you can see this. 00:07:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:08Wedge. 00:07:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:12Okay? 00:07:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:23So, in the pediatric population, the healing of fractures is divided into 3 phases, the inflammatory or acute phase, the reparative or the subacute phase, and finally, the remodeling or chronic phase. 00:07:37And remodeling is much more extensive in an adult population. 00:07:42And children's fractures don't always remodel with great results. 00:07:  adult population. 00:07:42And children's fractures don't always remodel with great results. 00:07:45Again, it depends on the type of fracture and how that growth plate is impacted. 00:07:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:53So that remodeling capacity is really dependent on three basic factors the skeletal age of the child the distance of the fracture site and the growth plate and then the severity of displacement of the fragments. 00:08:08[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:01:32Open reduction of fractures surgically expose the fracture site. 00:01:37Fixation is the method of maintaining fracture fragments in position after reduction in order to achieve healing. 00:01:44All fractures benefit from fixation immediately to provide pain relief, and over time to promote healing. 00:01:52[BL  motion, vasomotor instability, skin changes, and patchy bone demineralization. 00:10:08The onset is often after a fracture or surgery. 00:10:10The pathogenesis is unknown. 00:10:13Pain is the most prominent and debilitating symptoms. 00:10:15[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:18There are often other symptoms, and various types of sensory abnormalities are common in CRPS. 00:10:23About two-thirds of patients with CRPS have functional motor impairments related to pain. 00:10:29Impairment is typically manifested by a reduction of complex muscle strength and hand grip, or during standing on your toes. 00:10:37Limb movement may be limited by edema, pain, or contractures. 00:10:41Some patients develop central motor manifestations such as tremor, myoclonus, dystonic postures, or impaired initiation of movement. All fractures benefit from fixation immediately to provide pain relief, and over time to promote healing. 00:01:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:55Fixation of fractures. 00:01:57An external fixation would include a plaster cast or a splint. 00:02:02An internal fixation includes pins, wires, plates, screws, rods, other kinds of hardware. 00:02:10ORIF stands for open reduction internal fixation. 00:02:15So an external fixation is with a plaster cast, immobilization, or a splint is used to maintain a closed reduction. 00:02:22And open reduction uses an internal fixation, which employs orthopedic hardware or appliances such as pins, wires, plates, screws. 00:02:32And a combination of both open reduction and internal fixation is often referred to by that abbreviation, ORIF. 00:02:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:  to by that abbreviation, ORIF. 00:02:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:47So fixation, and here we have three types of fixation displayed on three different patients. 00:02:54In A, and we have a plaster cast on that side. 00:02:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:02And this plaster cast is immobilizing a distal radius fracture, and you can see the fracture with the arrow right here. 00:03:10In B, we have internal fixation, and this is plate and hardware used for wrist arthrodesis. 00:03:20And this is a fusion technique to relieve pain and provide stability in patients with advanced arthritis. 00:03:26In C, we have a combination of internal and external fixation, and this is a standard uniplanar external fixator used for the treatment of a comminuted distal radius fracture. 00:03  standard uniplanar external fixator used for the treatment of a comminuted distal radius fracture. 00:03:38So the pins are anchored into the second metacarpal and the radial shaft. 00:03:44The ulnar styloid fracture is also present. 00:03:49And you see that here, that ulnar styloid fracture, we can see this, what a mess, huh? 00:03:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:09So here we have an image of a fixation, an open reduction internal fixation of the right radius. 00:04:16And this person fell from a ladder of a height of only 80 centimeters, and they came in with right elbow pain and obviously there was a fracture. 00:04:27And an ORIF was performed one day after the initial presentation. 00:04:31And so we see that fracture, dislocation of the right radius there. 00:  initial presentation. 00:04:31And so we see that fracture, dislocation of the right radius there. 00:04:35[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:39And the ORIF, 00:04:41[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:44Carried out one day after his initial trauma. 00:04:47[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:53So fracture healing. 00:04:55We have cortical bone healing, cancellous bone healing, and surgically compressed and fixated bone healing. 00:05:02So cortical bone fractures heal by the formation of new bone, or callus, bridging a fractured gap. 00:05:09Cancellous bone fractures unite with little or no callus formation. 00:05:14Healing occurs via direct osteoblastic activity at the fracture site, also referred to as creeping substitution. 00:05:22Surgically  direct osteoblastic activity at the fracture site, also referred to as creeping substitution. 00:05:22Surgically compressed and fixated bone heals via direct osteoblastic activity with little or no periosteal reaction or callus formation. 00:05:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:39Cortical bone healing. 00:05:40Fracture healing in cortical bone, as we see an A, a hematoma fills in the fracture site after the periosteum and the endosteum rupture. 00:05:51So we have this fracture going all the way through here and the hematoma filling it up. 00:06:00And the periosteal and endosteal response results in bone deposition that proceeds toward the fracture. 00:06:08So that's what we're seeing right here, this bone deposition, and creeping in that way. 00:06:13[BL 's what we're seeing right here, this bone deposition, and creeping in that way. 00:06:13[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:16And in C, you can see that a collar of callus surrounds the fracture site, and this will progressively remodel over time. 00:06:26The primary callus is eventually replaced by a secondary callus. 00:06:31And this callus becomes organized in response to mechanical stresses on the bone. 00:06:36Recall the lecture earlier on Wolff's law, right, bone is going to remodel based due to the demands that are placed on it 00:06:43[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:50And this image is an example of cancellous bone healing. 00:06:54And this is inter-trabecular bone formation seven days after a drill hole is placed in the proximal tibia of the mouse. 00:07 ecular bone formation seven days after a drill hole is placed in the proximal tibia of the mouse. 00:07:02So we can imagine a drill hole right through this area, and this is seven days afterwards. 00:07:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:15And so we can already see some of that new bone formation. 00:07:19So cancellous bone injuries occur in vertebral compression fractures, and distal radius fractures, tibial condyle fractures, etc. 00:07:30Cancellous bone fractures unite with little or no callus formation, and instead they heal by membranous bone formation. 00:07:37Intra-trabecular bone formation occurs quickly, and healing occurs via direct osteoblastic activity at the fracture site, also referred to as creeping substitution. 00:07:50This method of healing requires that the fracture fragments be in close contact with each other. 00  substitution. 00:07:50This method of healing requires that the fracture fragments be in close contact with each other. 00:07:55If approximation cannot be achieved, the hematoma fills in the gap and the healing proceeds by callus formation. 00:08:03Cancellous bone formation is spatially restricted. 00:08:07It does not extend to more than a few millimeters outside of the injured region. 00:08:11The filling of a defective cancellous bone of a few millimeters width can therefore be slow or even incomplete. 00:08:19This is quite different from shaft fracture healing, which can fill up considerable gaps. 00:08:24So if the gap in cancellous bone during instrumented fixation or joint replacement surgery is more than a few millimeters, healing can be slow or incomplete, and rarely if it's greater than two millimeters in width. 00:08:37[BLANK_AUDIO] 00  rarely if it's greater than two millimeters in width. 00:08:37[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:44Surgically compressed bone healing. 00:08:47So fracture healing on compressed and surgically fixated bone occurs via direct osteoblastic activity with little or no periosteal reaction or callus formation. 00:08:58Immediate remodeling occurs as bone deposition and resorption continuous simultaneously as a result of osteoblastic and osteoclastic cell activity. 00:09:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:16So here we're looking at three images of a fracture to a 17-year-old girl. 00:09:21In image A, the fracture fragments are displaced laterally, and so we're looking here at the tibia. 00:09:28You see that displacement in the fibula, and you see that displacement. 00:09:34And B, we 28You see that displacement in the fibula, and you see that displacement. 00:09:34And B, we're seeing the formation of callus, you can see these lumps forming there, callus formation. 00:09:43And then in C, no evidence of fracture lines remain, but we do see, 00:09:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:51A residual callus formation. 00:09:54So successful healing of both fractures is what we're looking at here with these three images. 00:10:00In image A, these are emergency room films made after a sledding accident. 00:10:06And so the fracture is located at the junction of the distal and middle thirds of the shafts of the tibia and fibula. 00:10:14In both bones, the fracture fragments are overriding and displaced laterally, good alignment exists. 00:10:21In image B,  central motor manifestations such as tremor, myoclonus, dystonic postures, or impaired initiation of movement. 00:10:52Autonomic changes can also occur, and that includes differences in skin temperature, skin color, sweat, or edema, these are common. 00:11:01Skin changes can affect the connective tissue in CRPS. 00:11:05And those may include increased hair growth, increased or decreased nail growth, contraction and fibrosis of joints and fascia, as well as skin atrophy. 00:11:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:20So we would consider CRPS if the following symptoms are present. 00:11:25Number 1, pain, sensory changes, motor symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, or trophic changes, which develop after limb trauma, usually within four to six weeks. 00:11:37Number 2, the symptoms are no longer fully explained by the initial trauma.  bones, the fracture fragments are overriding and displaced laterally, good alignment exists. 00:10:21In image B, 00:10:22[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:24These are follow-up films taken three weeks later. 00:10:28And the image is taken through the plaster cast and it shows formation of callus bridging the fracture gap. 00:10:35So this patient did have external fixation, she had the plaster cast. 00:10:40And C, these are follow-up films taken one year later, and they show good progression of remodeling and no evidence of the fracture lines. 00:10:49[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:05:01If both sides have vascular disruption, then the chances of healing are very low. 00:05:07Corticosteroids are powerful inhibitors  vascular disruption, then the chances of healing are very low. 00:05:07Corticosteroids are powerful inhibitors of the rate of fracture healing, and growth hormones stimulate fracture healing. 00:05:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:16Forces acting on the fracture site stimulate bone healing, but while appropriate stress to the fracture site can be beneficial unwanted motion at the fracture site can result in delayed union or even malunion. 00:05:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:35This is an image of a radial malunited fracture and ulnar fracture non-union. 00:05:41So this is an old distal owner and radio fracture in this video of graph of a 15 year old male. 00:05:48Let's see evidence of a fractured gap and bone resorption at the distal ulnar, answer here. 00:05:55[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06  at the distal ulnar, answer here. 00:05:55[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:04And there's no callus formation. 00:06:06You also see this medially angulated malunited distal radius fracture, so you see this fracture it's malunited [INAUDIBLE] Again the two things to take away from this are this fractured gap here and there's evidence of bone resorption here. 00:06:31You can see how this is sort of diffuse and then the final thing to take away is this medial angulation. 00:06:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:43This is a malunited fracture mid-shaft of the right humerus with outward bowing, and you can also see osteoarthritis of the glenohumeral joint. 00:06:55So this is a 55 year old female with right arm swelling, she has a history eral joint. 00:06:55So this is a 55 year old female with right arm swelling, she has a history of right arm trauma and its been ongoing for six months after a fall in the bathroom and she was treated at another hospital. 00:07:09The patient indicated that she refused surgery, and therefore the fracture was treated conservatively with an arm sling. 00:07:17This resulted in malalignment of the humerus and healing occurred in this malunited fashion. 00:07:22Malunited fractures cause mechanical changes that can lead to osteoarthritis in nearby joints. 00:07:29And so what I'd like you to see here in this image is if we look at the glenohumeral joint, you can see the lack of space, and we can also see this sclerotic change here. 00:07:42Of course, the obvious presence here is this malunion 00:07:48[BLANK_  00:07:42Of course, the obvious presence here is this malunion 00:07:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:00So if radiologic examination during fracture healing. 00:08:03The frequency of examination depends on the stability of the fracture and the need to monitor any complications. 00:08:12The least amount of radiographic monitoring is appropriate in a non-displaced, uncomplicated closed fracture immobilized in a cast. 00:08:21In this case, the patient would have initial radiographs to diagnose and direct treatment, and then no further radiographs until the cast is removed approximately six weeks later. 00:08:33And these images would be to document evidence of successful healing. 00:08:38Displaced fractures may be radiographed frequently. 00:08:41Also fractures that demonstrate potential alignment problems or fractures that are at risk for other complication may be imaged more frequently, even at one or two  demonstrate potential alignment problems or fractures that are at risk for other complication may be imaged more frequently, even at one or two week intervals. 00:08:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:58Complications in fracture healing, there are a number of complications that can interrupt fracture healing or impact fracture healing. 00:09:06And here are some of the complications that can be related to fracture healing, threatening condition such as hemorrhage, or tetanus, complications and associated tissues such as compartment syndrome or infection. 00:09:21Complications of bone at a fracture site such as nonunion, or malunion, or pseudarthrosis ,as we mentioned earlier, and then late-effect complications, such as complex regional pain syndrome. 00:09:35[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:45So continuing with complications in fracture healing, delayed union is present in any situation where a fracture fails to unite in a timeframe usually required for union  complications in fracture healing, delayed union is present in any situation where a fracture fails to unite in a timeframe usually required for union. 00:09:57Although fracture healing is delayed, the process of cellular repair is present, and this will continue on to complete union, provided that the adverse factors that are delaying the union are removed, and no additional stresses are imposed. 00:10:11Causes of delayed union may be disrupted vascularity, infection, inadequate or interrupted immobilization, unsatisfactory reduction, severe local trauma, loss of bone substance, or wide distraction of fragments. 00:10:28Slow union may occur in many fractures, even when conditions are ideal. 00:10:33Even though the rate may be slow, this may be an average rate for the given conditions, such as age or fracture site, and is therefore not pathological. 00:10:43Nonunion is failure of fracture fragments to unite and the repair process is ceased. 00:10:49The 10:43Nonunion is failure of fracture fragments to unite and the repair process is ceased. 00:10:49The factors contributing to delayed union if left unchecked will cause nonunion. 00:10:54[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:04So in this slide, we're looking at a scaphoid fracture. 00:11:07In image A ,we can see the fracture site there. 00:11:12And in image B, we can still see the fracture site, there's no indication of fracture healing, that fracture is still present despite the hardware. 00:11:23And in image C, you see six weeks later, there are still nonunion of the scaphoid, and you can still see this gap [UNKNOWN] here. 00:11:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:41So the fracture is, in this case, occurring through the waist of the scaphoid. 00: :11:41So the fracture is, in this case, occurring through the waist of the scaphoid. 00:11:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:51In A, the arrows mark the fracture site. 00:11:53In B right here, the fracture was internally fixated with three pins. 00:11:59And so the the film made in B was two months after the surgery. 00:12:04And as I mentioned earlier, it shows no indication of fracture healing. 00:12:08That radiolucent line represents the fracture site and it's unchanged from image A. 00:12:14And so the hardware or the pins were subsequently removed. 00:12:17In image C, this follow-up film was made six weeks after the hardware removal. 00:12:23And again, as I mentioned earlier, it shows a nonunion of the scaphoid 00:12:27[ 23And again, as I mentioned earlier, it shows a nonunion of the scaphoid 00:12:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:33Complications in fracture healing can include malunion, where the fracture is united, but an angular or a rotational deformity exists. 00:12:42Recall that slide from earlier with the angulator radius. 00:12:47Pseudoarthrosis is another complication, the creation of a false joint when the ends of the bones in a nonunion become surrounded by a bursal sac. 00:12:57Osteomyelitis, a pathogen is spread from an open fracture or a surgical fixation. 00:13:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:11Pseudarthrosis or false joint is an abnormal condition at a nonunion fracture site, where a bursal sac surrounds the fracture site, and as depicted here. 00:13:  four to six weeks. 00:11:37Number 2, the symptoms are no longer fully explained by the initial trauma. 00:11:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:43And number 3, the symptoms affect the distal limb, they go beyond the region involved in the trauma, or they extend beyond the territory innervated by a single nerve or nerve root. 00:11:54There is a more elaborate set of criteria compared to the three above, which includes possible imaging, and the clinical diagnostic criteria are comprised of the Budapest consensus criteria. 00:12:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:10CRPS and patient history. 00:12:13Is the patient history consistent with a neurological or musculoskeletal issue that may respond to physical therapy treatment? 00:12:20Does it make sense to you or does it seem off? 00:12:24Given the patient history, have you decided whether  nonunion fracture site, where a bursal sac surrounds the fracture site, and as depicted here. 00:13:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:30And this is an image of avascular necrosis where a blood supply to a bone is compromised, which then leads to bone death. 00:13:40And in this image, this is avascular necrosis of the lunate in a 25-year-old man. 00:13:45The increased density of the lunate represents the body's attempt to revascularize and produce new bone. 00:13:53And so you can see this, it's lit up and much brighter. 00:13:56[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:00So C is capitate, L is lunate, the S is the scaphoid, and Tq is triquetrum. 00:14:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14: , and Tq is triquetrum. 00:14:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:11So complications in fracture healing occurring in other tissues. 00:14:16Heterotopic ossification, where we have formation of bone in muscle and soft tissue. 00:14:21Myositis ossificans, when skeletal muscle is involved, and fasciitis ossificans, when fascia is involved. 00:14:29Arterial injury, fractures and dislocations can result in vascular injury. 00:14:34Nerve injury, usually temporary neuropraxia occurs from a nerve stretch, but serious nerve injuries usually are associated with open fractures. 00:14:44So heterotropic ossification can occur at any age, but typically affects young adults with a clear history of local trauma or surgery. 00:14:53The formation of heterotopic ossification after orthopedic trauma  of local trauma or surgery. 00:14:53The formation of heterotopic ossification after orthopedic trauma has been studied most extensively in the setting of fractures of the acetabulum and fractures of the elbow. 00:15:03There's also a high incidence of heterotopic ossification after hip arthroplasty, hip replacement, traumatic amputations, traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury, and severe burns. 00:15:17Arterial injuries are associated with a small percentage of fractures. 00:15:21Fortunately, most nerve injuries associated with fractures and dislocations are temporary, and they generally result, as I mentioned earlier, from stretching of the nerve, and these resolve spontaneously over time. 00:15:34Many patients experience temporary paresthesia as a result of soft tissue edema. 00:15:39This is also benign and self-limited. 00:15:41More serious nerve injuries are associated with open 15:39This is also benign and self-limited. 00:15:41More serious nerve injuries are associated with open fractures and penetrating injuries. 00:15:47Fractures near the elbow and knee are most often involved, as are dislocations of the hip, knee, and shoulder. 00:15:54Open exploration and nerve repair are often necessary in such cases. 00:15:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:16:02Suspected arterial injury in primary care Generally, we would assess distal circulation in all patients with suspected fracture or dislocation. 00:16:12We would assess circulation as soon as possible. 00:16:15When dislocation or fracture is accompanied by the absence of pulse and orthopedic care is not available, then we would attempt reduction. 00:16:25So one article in particular advises primary care providers to minimize adverse outcomes of arterial injuries by following these parameters. 00:16:35  article in particular advises primary care providers to minimize adverse outcomes of arterial injuries by following these parameters. 00:16:35Assess distal circulation in all patients with a fracture or dislocation. 00:16:39Slow pulse, pallor, and slow capillary refill, which is defined as more than three seconds, are signs of arterial injury. 00:16:48Assess circulation as soon as possible before radiographic examination. 00:16:53When dislocations and fractures are accompanied by the absence of pulse, and orthopedic care is not readily available, primary care providers should attempt reduction. 00:17:03In many cases, the artery is kinked rather than torn. 00:17:06If the limb is pulseless, much is to be gained and little lost by attempting reduction. 00:17:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:17:15Compartment syndrome. 00:17:16Increased pressure within a closed BLANK_AUDIO] 00:17:15Compartment syndrome. 00:17:16Increased pressure within a closed space compromises circulation and tissue function, and this can result in ischemic necrosis. 00:17:25So the signs of compartment syndrome are the 5 P's, pain, pallor, paresthesia, paralysis, and pulselessness. 00:17:33But these are not always present. 00:17:36A compartment syndrome is a condition in which the circulation and the function of the tissues within a closed space are compromised again by increased pressure within that space. 00:17:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:17:49The pain is generally deep and poorly localized. 00:17:53The pallor is distal to the compartment. 00:17:56And the paraesthesia is usually of a sensory nerve passing through the compartment. 00:18:01Paralysis, permanent damage's likely without treatment.  usually of a sensory nerve passing through the compartment. 00:18:01Paralysis, permanent damage's likely without treatment. 00:18:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:18:14Life-threatening conditions include hemorrhage, and this is the most common life-threatening condition associated with a fracture. 00:18:21Fat embolism is usually associated with multiple fractures, motor vehicle accident, crushing injury, and fat from the bone marrow enters the veins, eventually lodging an artery in the lungs. 00:18:33Pulmonary embolism is usually related to immobilization and decreased activity associated with fracture healing, which increases the risk of venous thrombosis. 00:18:44A minority of fractures have life-threatening consequences. 00:18:47The key to the management of these conditions is early recognition and proper treatment. 00:18:53Regarding hemorrhage, half of all pelvic fractures require a transfusion. 00:18  proper treatment. 00:18:53Regarding hemorrhage, half of all pelvic fractures require a transfusion. 00:18:59Closed femoral fractures can also result in severe hemorrhage. 00:19:03A fat embolism in a single fracture is rare, but when it does occur, it is usually associated with long bone fractures in young adults, or hip fractures in the elderly. 00:19:14Crushing type fractures allow fat from the bone marrow to enter the veins in the form of globules, which eventually lodge in one of the arteries of the lung. 00:19:23Fat embolisms generally develops 12 hours after a fracture, but can appear up to 72 hours after a fracture. 00:19:31Symptoms are similar to those with pulmonary embolism in the early stages. 00:19:35Clinical signs include a fever, hypoxia, confusion, restlessness, changing neurological signs, urinary incontinence, and inical signs include a fever, hypoxia, confusion, restlessness, changing neurological signs, urinary incontinence, and a particular rash across the chest and in conjunctiva. 00:19:48The classic signs of pulmonary embolism are sudden onset of dyspnea and anxiety with or without substernal pain. 00:19:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:20:00Additional life-threatening conditions. 00:20:03Gas gangrene is usually associated with a deep-penetrating injury and contamination with Clostridium. 00:20:09Gas is produced from the fermentation of muscle sugars and spreads along the muscle. 00:20:14Tetanus is usually associated with an open fracture, and it's contaminated with Clostridium tetani. 00:20:21Infection stays in the wound, producing toxin that passes along nerves to the spinal cord. 00:20:27Gas gangrene after a fracture is  wound, producing toxin that passes along nerves to the spinal cord. 00:20:27Gas gangrene after a fracture is almost always associated with a deep penetrating injury to muscle. 00:20:34The Clostridium group of organisms responsible for this condition is found in the intestinal tracts of humans and animals. 00:20:40The risk of contamination was always present because these organisms are found everywhere, from barnyards to hospital operating rooms. 00:20:50Initial symptoms are pain, edema, and exudate of thin dark fluid. 00:20:55The fluid and bubbles of foul smelling gas produced from the fermentation of the muscle sugars, spread along the muscle sheaths, separating the sheath from the muscle. 00:21:05It can be physically pressed up and down the length of the muscle. 00:21:08The fluid is highly toxic, and the condition can rapidly progress to toxemia and death. 00:21:14In tetanus  it make sense to you or does it seem off? 00:12:24Given the patient history, have you decided whether other body systems or body regions, upper or lower quadrant, should be screened in addition? 00:12:33The location of symptoms may alert you to warning signs for serious disorders. 00:12:38Specific medical screening questionnaires and questions related to patient history will help you collect valuable information. 00:12:46[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:02:54Just like the last slide, paying attention to patient demographics and symptom patterns can give you a clue regarding differential diagnoses. 00:03:05Factors may include family history, health history, and viral infections. 00:03:11The presence of family history can be a significant risk factor, often seen in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis,  fluid is highly toxic, and the condition can rapidly progress to toxemia and death. 00:21:14In tetanus, open fractures can also be contaminated by Clostridium tetani. 00:21:21And this is commonly found in soil. 00:21:24The resulting infection stays localized in the wound, and in this respect, is the opposite of the infection causing gas gangrene. 00:21:32However, it produces toxins that are more virulent than the deadliest snake venom. 00:21:37Within seven to ten days, the toxin gradually passes along nerves from the wound to the spinal cord, anchoring onto the motor neurons. 00:21:45Stimulation of the motor nerves causes rigidity and convulsions. 00:21:48The jaw muscles are involved earliest, hence the name lock jaw. 00:21:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:21:57So we'll talk a little bit now about :21:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:21:57So we'll talk a little bit now about commonly missed fractures. 00:22:00And these are usually linked to failure to order radiography, failure to recognize fractures on radiograph. 00:22:08Subtle fractures that may not be evident on initial radiograph, or presence of multiple injuries, or inadequate patient histories. 00:22:16Fractures are not usually missed by patients. 00:22:19Acute pain is pretty reliable. 00:22:21Fractures are missed by clinicians, and studies indicate these errors are usually linked to one of the following factors. 00:22:28And those are the ones that we mentioned above. 00:22:30[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:22:34So the importance of history and physical examination, and commonly missed fractures. 00:22:39Patient history. 00:22:40What's  and physical examination, and commonly missed fractures. 00:22:39Patient history. 00:22:40What's their trauma? 00:22:41What was the mechanism of injury? 00:22:44And the physical examination is their tenderness to palpation, the clinical prediction rules in the American College of Radiology Criteria. 00:22:52Communication, communicating information from your patient examination to the radiologist may be crucial to helping the radiologist interpret the image without overlooking or missing important findings. 00:23:05So, trauma usually precipitates a fracture, but sometimes the onset is insidious or unknown, such as stress fractures or bone stress injuries, and runners for osteoporosis. 00:23:17During the physical exam, acute point tenderness to palpation over the fracture site is both a reliable perception of the patient and a reliable clinical sign of a fracture. 00:23:28Clinical decision rules are well substantiated lists of  patient and a reliable clinical sign of a fracture. 00:23:28Clinical decision rules are well substantiated lists of clinical patient factors that have a strong predictive value in determining whether a patient has a fracture or not. 00:23:39The application of clinical decision rules helps to ensure that injuries requiring definition by radiography do get image, and helps to prevent unnecessary imaging for injuries for which outcome is unaffected by imaging. 00:23:53So essentially, we're trying to limit imaging in cases where it's not necessary, and make sure we have imaging performed in those cases where it's very likely to be meaningful. 00:24:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:24:07The rule of treatment in fracture management. 00:24:10If suspicion for fracture is high and imaging is negative, treat it as a fracture, immobilize it, and re-evaluate with imaging in one to two weeks. 00:24:18Always err on the side ize it, and re-evaluate with imaging in one to two weeks. 00:24:18Always err on the side of caution. 00:24:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:24:25So if a fracture is present, it will announce itself on the follow up radiograph by localized density changes of effective site. 00:24:34And if a fracture's not present, the patient has only suffered a minor inconvenience. 00:24:38The good sense of this fracture management principle avoids the detrimental possibilities of an unstabilized fracture, and the reality of malpractice actions. 00:24:47Errors on the side of caution rarely have adverse outcomes. 00:24:51[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:01:52So we can see gout here on the first toe, but we can also see it on the third and 01:52So we can see gout here on the first toe, but we can also see it on the third and the second up here, and it's even present at the midfoot and the sinus tarsi. 00:02:06And if the image were rotated, we'd actually see it on the lateral aspect of the foot and ankle involving the lateral ankle ligament complex in this patient, like we see here. 00:02:18[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:20Okay, something like this. 00:02:22[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:24So, how does CT work? 00:02:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:28Well, with CT, we have an x-ray emitter over here that actually rotates around a patient, and we also have a detector here with the letter D, and the green arrow. 00:02:42And that , and we also have a detector here with the letter D, and the green arrow. 00:02:42And that's placed on the opposite side, and that detector picks up the image of a body section, and the beam and the detector move in synchrony, and they rotate, 00:02:55[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:57Around, and so unlike an x-ray, the detector of the CT doesn't actually produce an image. 00:03:04Instead, it measures the transmission of x-rays through a full CT of the body and then the image of that section is taken from different angles. 00:03:13And that allows us to retrieve that third dimension, as opposed to x-rays where we only have two dimensions. 00:03:20So, to get those 3D images of a patient, the computer uses a bunch of mathematical algorithms and reconstructs the image using that data from the CT and that's  a patient, the computer uses a bunch of mathematical algorithms and reconstructs the image using that data from the CT and that's. 00:03:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:38Sir Godfrey Hounsfield, is the gentleman who's credited with coming up with the idea for a CT scanner, and this is his sketch of the idea for the CT. 00:03:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:55So this is Mr Hounsfield in 1972 and the first CT image of the human brain was made about 50 years ago on October 1st 1971. 00:04:06And we should notice here is the size of the scanner because it was dedicated to only scanning the head. 00:04:14So, CT revolutionized the ability to visualize soft tissues and the guy who revolutionized it was an engineer and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1979. 00:04:27And the idea for the ized it was an engineer and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1979. 00:04:27And the idea for the CT came from a discussion Hounsfield had with a physician, who noted that while the x-rays were great at imaging bones, they were not so great at being able to look at soft tissues such as the brain very well. 00:04:43So Mr. Hounsfield decided that you could look at slices of the brain using x-rays, beamed at different angles. 00:04:52And, Hounsfield divided into consecutive slices the brain like a sliced loaf of bread, and the x-rays would be beamed through each slice of bread, once for each degree in a half circle. 00:05:05So, 180 degrees or 180 beam slices, so, again, you imagine we have our emitter over here. 00:05:11Receptors here and slowly collecting images at different angles, and  have our emitter over here. 00:05:11Receptors here and slowly collecting images at different angles, and so the strength of the beam would be caught on the opposite side by the detector and more intense signals would result from stronger beams. 00:05:34And the stronger beams would indicate that the beam signals had traveled through tissue that was less dense, while weaker signals being caught by the receptor would indicate that the beam had traveled through tissue that was more dense. 00:05:49So, Hounsfield created an algorithm to reconstruct the image based on these layers from all of these different angles. 00:05:57And, by working backward and using one of the fastest new computers back in the 70s, Hounsfield could calculate the value for each little box of each brain layer. 00:06:11And so what we're looking here at are the different angles that the beams are passing through, giving us a little bit of data for each  can be a significant risk factor, often seen in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. 00:03:21Health history is another critical component for a disease risk assessment, with lots of conditions tied to specific background risks, such as joint infection and autoimmune disorders. 00:03:32Viral infections, sunlight exposure, and the use of certain medications can all contribute to systemic lupus erythematosus. 00:03:41And this illustrates the complexity of health history as a risk determiner. 00:03:46The patient's symptom description. 00:03:48Important information can be learned just from a patient's description of their symptoms. 00:03:53A mnemonic O.P.Q.R.S.T can help you organize your approach to a patient's chief complaint. 00:04:02So a comprehensive examination of a patient  we're looking here at are the different angles that the beams are passing through, giving us a little bit of data for each angle. 00:06:24So the team installed a full-size CT scanner at a hospital in London on October 1, 1971. 00:06:31They scanned their first patient who is a middle aged woman with evidence of a brain tumor in the left frontal lobe, sort of like here, this dark area. 00:06:43So the process included about 30 minutes for the scan, and then driving across town with all these magnetic tapes with all the data on it. 00:06:52In two and a half hours to process the data on a big mainframe computer, and then capturing the image with a polaroid camera, and then driving back all the way across town to the hospital. 00:07:06So quite a process, so here's Hounsfield being presented with his Nobel Prize in 1979, and modern scanners are obviously  quite a process, so here's Hounsfield being presented with his Nobel Prize in 1979, and modern scanners are obviously much faster. 00:07:17They provide higher resolution and most important, they do it with less radiation exposure. 00:07:22They're even mobile CT scanners now, and there are more than 80 million CT scans taken annually in the United States. 00:07:30[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:03:22And it's a three-dimensional reformatted CT image. 00:03:27And in it, we can see the tibia, and fibula, and the peroneus longus, and brevis. 00:03:34And here we can see the Achilles tendon and the calcaneus. 00:03:39And with these kinds of images, you can see much more clearly how tendons might aneus. 00:03:39And with these kinds of images, you can see much more clearly how tendons might move over areas of a healed fracture, or you might be able to see subtle joint degenerative changes. 00:03:54You could just see much more in detail than you can in some of the other kinds of radiography. 00:04:01So some of the different forms of CT imaging include three-dimensional CT like we saw on the last slide or on the first slide with the gout. 00:04:09Then there's a CT Myelogram and a Cone Beam CT. 00:04:14So as the name applies, the three-dimensional CT is created by what's called volumetric scanning. 00:04:20So you put together slices and pieces of slices, allowing body parts to be rotated on a computer screen. 00:04:27A CT myelogram, and this is used less often over time  rotated on a computer screen. 00:04:27A CT myelogram, and this is used less often over time because it requires injection of contrast material into the subarachnoid space. 00:04:36It's useful in limited cases such as operative spinal stenosis. 00:04:42Cone Beam CT instead of the patient moving continuously through the unit a cone beam CT gathers all the data in one sweep of the scanner using a large cone shaped X ray beam. 00:04:56And images instead of slices then are based on one large volume of data, and scanning time is shorter with less radiation exposure. 00:05:05And this is used most frequently in the hand and wrist, and also in dentistry. 00:05:10So this is a CT myelogram of L4-L5, and this is taken from your McKinney's book. 00:05:16The L4 nerve exits above the level displayed in the  is taken from your McKinney's book. 00:05:16The L4 nerve exits above the level displayed in the image, but here in the image you can see. 00:05:22The L5 nerve root, this sort of gray area here, a little more diffuse. 00:05:28And one of the things I'd like you to take away is that because it's a myelogram, we know that there's a substance that's been injected into here. 00:05:38And the structures we can see here are the multifidus, and the ligamentum flavum here. 00:05:45The capsule the preset joint here, the thecall sac with the cauda equina here. 00:05:53We can see the inferior articular process here of L 4, and facet joint and a superior process at L 5 right there. 00:06:02[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:04Ess  process at L 5 right there. 00:06:02[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:04Essentially though, you would get much more detail in this area with the myelogram than you would with a traditional x-ray. 00:06:14So viewing CT images, recall PACS, Picture Archiving and Communication Systems. 00:06:21And these digital storage systems allow the image to be stored and transferred to different locations, and the image quality is maintained. 00:06:32And so I think the thing to really keep in mind here is that this digital sort of system is much different than, as we mentioned in one of the earlier lectures. 00:06:41Transferring physical copies of images, X-ray images etc., between locations much more efficient, much higher quality information. 00:06:54So viewing CT images, the image radio densities are similar to conventional radiographs. 00:07:01And shades of So viewing CT images, the image radio densities are similar to conventional radiographs. 00:07:01And shades of gray are going to reflect the radio density of the tissue. 00:07:06Denser structures in CT are going to appear white or brighter, and less dense structures are going to appear dark. 00:07:14So, as opposed to CT, in an MRI, the dense structures appear dark or black, all right? 00:07:22So CT, dense structures appear white or bright. 00:07:25MRI, the dense structures are going to appear dark or black. 00:07:30And so, if we look at the image here on the right, this is a mid-sagittal CT image of the cervical spine from your McKinnis book. 00:07:41It's an 80-year-old man with significant spinal stenosis. 00:07:45And, if we look at the cortical bone of year-old man with significant spinal stenosis. 00:07:45And, if we look at the cortical bone of the posterior occiput, right, the posterior part of the skull right here, we can see it appears very bright or white. 00:07:56And if we compare that to the CT vertebrae right here, this is gray because of the cancellous bone versus the cortical bone of number one. 00:08:06And then the trapezius muscle 3, it's a little darker, but it's not quite as dark as the subcutaneous fat at number 4. 00:08:17And then the air in the pharynx is black, or radiolucent right here. 00:08:25And then the other thing to note in this picture is the width of the spinal canal is much greater at the atlantoaxial joint right here at A, when we compare it to down here at the level of C  at the atlantoaxial joint right here at A, when we compare it to down here at the level of C7 and B, and that's because there's a retrolisthesis at the C5, 6 and the C6, 7 arrows. 00:08:49Get rid of that so you can see those arrows a little better, okay? 00:08:53So that's right here, see 5, 6 and see 6, 7. 00:08:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:02So here's an image of L1 with degenerative changes and this is a transverse slice from an axial image. 00:09:10As if the patient were in a supine position with the viewer standing at the feet looking up. 00:09:17And sagittal images are viewed from left to right, while coronal images are viewed as if the patient is facing the viewer, viewing images from front to back  left to right, while coronal images are viewed as if the patient is facing the viewer, viewing images from front to back. 00:09:27So, again, this is an axial slice of the L1 vertebra of an older woman with significant degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. 00:09:36So, number 1 here is the liver and the 12th rib is on the right here in number 2, and the diaphragm here, let's see that, in number 3. 00:09:55And then an osteophyte off the right side of the vertebral body it's present right here in 4. 00:10:05And finally, the abdominal aorta we can see in the dashed outline over there. 00:10:10And the left kidney in 5, right here. 00:10:15And then finally, the spinous process here in 6. 00:10:19[BLANK_AUD  can help you organize your approach to a patient's chief complaint. 00:04:02So a comprehensive examination of a patient's primary complaints involving details about the area and the nature of symptoms, the onset, aggravating and relieving factors, and daily pain variations can be crucial to informing your understanding of the patient's health status. 00:04:20With common symptomatic patterns and assumptions underpinning therapy approaches. 00:04:26So the mnemonic OPQRST symptom description, O is onset of symptoms, and then P is provocation and palliative, Q is quality. 00:04:37R is region and radiation, S is severity, and T is timing. 00:04:43So with O, the approach to a patient interview often involves starting with open-ended questions, followed by questions with increasing focus. 00:04:53The P is identifying what exacerbates or alleviate the patient's symptoms, and this can be very important for diagnosis and 10:15And then finally, the spinous process here in 6. 00:10:19[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:23So the key thing to keep in mind here is that you're viewing this image as if the patient is supine with you standing at the feet looking towards the patient's head. 00:10:37[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:43For evaluating bone CT produces tremendous results, and what we're looking at here in this image on the right is narrowing of the spinal canal and intervertebral foramina at the L5-S1 joint of a patient who's complaining of right leg pain. 00:11:02And number 1, we're looking at these sacroiliac joint right here, right, so the joint between these two surfaces. 00:11:10Number 2 is the sacral ala, and then number 3 is hypertrophy and superior articular processes of S1 Number 2 is the sacral ala, and then number 3 is hypertrophy and superior articular processes of S1, here. 00:11:20[INAUDIBLE] And those are causing narrowing of the intervertebral foramina. 00:11:27And number 4 is the vertebral body of S1 with large osteophytes on the lateral and posterior margins of the arrows. 00:11:36So if we look at the contour here, you can see how it puffs out there a little bit, and puffs out there a little bit, and also puffs out here. 00:11:48So the dotted line shows the normal outlines of the spinal canal. 00:11:54This area should normally just be space and we can see how this vertebral body has encroached on that space. 00:12:06This is an image of degenerative changes at the medial knee and it's a sagittal plane CT scan through 12:06This is an image of degenerative changes at the medial knee and it's a sagittal plane CT scan through the medial compartment of a knee that has significant degenerative changes and multiple loose bodies. 00:12:21And the loose bodies are in the posterior knee joint space. 00:12:26And we can see that they're bright or radio dense. 00:12:29And there's also a baker's cyst posterior to the joint here. 00:12:35[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:37And that baker cyst also contains multiple loose bodies. 00:12:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:44And in this CT image we're viewing a comminuted fracture of the left scapula. 00:12:49And so we see posterior and anterior views of a comminuted fracture of the left scapula from a patient who is a bicyclist who fell during a race.  a comminuted fracture of the left scapula from a patient who is a bicyclist who fell during a race. 00:12:59And suffered a direct impact on the scapula. 00:13:03This fracture was actually treated conservatively. 00:13:08So what are the limitations of CT? 00:13:12Well, different tissues, for example, a tumor and the surrounding muscle may be assigned the same shades of gray, so they may look similar if their radio densities are similar. 00:13:23There's also a relatively high radiation exposure from CT versus traditional radiography. 00:13:29So the tissue type or the histological makeup is difficult to determine from CT because tissues with similar radio densities will have similar shades of gray. 00:13:39Even if one of the tissues is a tumor and the other one is a muscle. 00:13:43And another meaningful concern with CT, as I mentioned,  tumor and the other one is a muscle. 00:13:43And another meaningful concern with CT, as I mentioned, is the relatively high radiation exposure associated with it versus other kinds of imaging modalities such as radiography like X-ray, or MRI or ultrasound 00:13:59[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:01:31So this is an image comparing CT and MRI, and you can see figure 4-15 in your McKinnis text. 00:01:39And this axial slice is referred to as the cross. 00:01:44And note on the MRI how the gray matter produced a lower signal intensity. 00:01:50It's darker than the white matter, and the subcutaneous fat is white. 00:01:58So regarding the CT exam in your McKinnis texts, please go through the six brain images from  00:01:58So regarding the CT exam in your McKinnis texts, please go through the six brain images from the six axial slices. 00:02:06And they reveal the Cross, the Star, Mr. Happy, Mr. Sad, the Worms, and the Coffee Bean. 00:02:15And this is an image of a CT without contrast showing a thrombosis in the right middle cerebral artery. 00:02:22You can see it, right? 00:02:26And this is an MRI 12 hours later, which demonstrates increased signal intensity, that brighter image with the dotted lines in front. 00:02:36[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:03:58So in this image we're looking at diffusion MRI again. 00:04:02This is white matter tractography, reconstruction and a normally sighted control  looking at diffusion MRI again. 00:04:02This is white matter tractography, reconstruction and a normally sighted control subject in A and paired with an age matched individual with cerebral visual cortical visual impairment B. 00:04:16So, in the individual on the left, individual A, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, the superior longitudinal fasciculus, and the inferior fronto occipital fasciculus are all evident. 00:04:31And now contrast that with the individual on the right, individual B. 00:04:36You can see the marked reductions in each of these fasciculus is evident. 00:04:41The color scheme represents the direction, just like we saw on the prior slide of the white outer fibers or the tracts. 00:04:52[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:01:46So, how does MRI  what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:01:46So, how does MRI work? 00:01:49Well, different body tissues contain different amounts of water and the variation in water content can be used to help differentiate various organs within the body. 00:01:58So, similar to how we discussed X-rays working with the different tissue densities attenuating the beam. 00:02:07The MRI works because different amounts of water result in a variation in the properties of the image. 00:02:14And we can see from this figure here, we look at gray matter, which is we'll say 85% water in this image and bone 17% water. 00:02:25That's going to result in structures with distinctly different image properties. 00:02:34So, the MRI machine. 00:02:36The early MR research really revolved around the idea again that different body tissues contain different amounts  machine. 00:02:36The early MR research really revolved around the idea again that different body tissues contain different amounts of water and the variation in water content could be used to help differentiate the various organs within the body. 00:02:50And so the MRI works by passing an electrical current through these coiled wires in the machine to create a temporary magnetic field in your body. 00:03:00And then a transmitter sends radio waves, and a receiver receives those radio waves and a computer uses those signals to make digital images of the scanned area of your body. 00:03:12So, the patient lies down inside this magnet here, and the radio wave antenna sends signals into the body and the receiver detects the signals and then that computer converts those signals to images. 00:03:28Here some of the basic elements of an MRI scanner, have a magnet, gradient coils and RF coils. 00:03:37And the computer controls the function of the gradient coils  have a magnet, gradient coils and RF coils. 00:03:37And the computer controls the function of the gradient coils and the RF coils, and it receives and processes the signal from the RF coils, and turns that signal into an image that we can then interpret. 00:03:52[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:01:38So looking at the bullet points, once inside a strong magnetic field, the protons line up either in the direction of the magnetic field. 00:01:46So in this case, 00:01:47[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:49In the direction of the magnetic field, here, or in the opposite of that direction. 00:01:57And the small difference in the number of protons aligned in these two directions is called the longitudinal magnetization. 00:02:06And then radio . 00:05:21Or starting to return to gardening, or yard work after the winter. 00:05:26If the onset of symptoms is truly insidious, if new symptoms occur during the course of treatment, or if resolved symptoms return for no apparent mechanical reason, then you should begin having some questions about the underlying nature of the condition. 00:05:44[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:47Behavior and pattern of symptoms. 00:05:49So has the intensity of the symptoms changed over time? 00:05:54Are symptoms affected by activity versus rest, or by the patient's position, or the time of day? 00:06:01Is the behavior of the symptoms generally predictable over a 24-hour period? 00:06:06So for many patients with neuromusculoskeletal disorders, a description of how symptoms do or do not change over a 24-hour period is adequate. 00:06:20For :53The P is identifying what exacerbates or alleviate the patient's symptoms, and this can be very important for diagnosis and treatment. 00:05:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:03Q is requiring a detailed description of a patient's pain and a comprehensive 24-hour report because this can indicate specific conditions. 00:05:13For example, gout is often characterized by a sudden onset and nighttime attacks while rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis often include extensive morning stiffness. 00:05:24And osteoarthritis might involve mild to moderate morning stiffness that relieves within 30 minutes of activity. 00:05:32But it could also present with nighttime discomfort. 00:05:36R, identifying the specific affected area, right, the region and radiation. 00:05:42Understanding the pattern of pain dispersion and the number of affected joints can really inform the cause of joint pain. 00:05  the number of protons aligned in these two directions is called the longitudinal magnetization. 00:02:06And then radiofrequency waves are applied at right angles to the alignment and the pulses alter the alignment of the protons to a new plane or orientation. 00:02:18So radiofrequency pulse sequence. 00:02:20A pulse sequence is a series of instructions that is repeated over and over to build up the data to create the magnetic resonance image. 00:02:30The spin echo sequence is a 90-degree pulse followed by a 180-degree pulse, after which, MRI signal is acquired from the protons. 00:02:40This is how the T1 and T2 images are created. 00:02:44So these are different processes and they help the MRI differentiate between different tissue types and pathologies. 00:02:52So displacement and gradual realignment of protons. 00:02:56In this image, the protons are aligned 52So displacement and gradual realignment of protons. 00:02:56In this image, the protons are aligned with the main magnetic field in 1. 00:03:01And then when a radio frequency pulse is applied at right angles, as we see in number 2 here, this results in altered alignment of the protons, which is in 3, right? 00:03:12So initially they were kind of going this way and then it's like this and now they're going that way. 00:03:19And after that radiofrequency pulse stops, the protons gradually return to alignment. 00:03:25So they move from pointing up that way, and they gradually start to rotate back down this way. 00:03:32And as they return to alignment with the magnetic field, they emit energy, and that energy that's emitted is measured. 00:03:42So we have the realignment of protons and decay. 00:03:  emitted is measured. 00:03:42So we have the realignment of protons and decay. 00:03:45So after that radio frequency pulse ceases, as we saw in that last slide, right? 00:03:51In the last slide we had an alignment this way, and after the pulse stops, the alignment gradually begins to change into this direction, and the energy released as this change occurs here is measured. 00:04:09So the energy that they absorb from that pulse is released. 00:04:12That energy creates a current in a receiver coil. 00:04:16And the change in current results in the data, which creates an MR image. 00:04:20[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:01:30So T1 recovery, the protons return to their longitudinal magnetization, right? 00:01:38 01:30So T1 recovery, the protons return to their longitudinal magnetization, right? 00:01:38And as they do that, they lose energy. 00:01:41Here's their energy lines again and the timing of the release of energy varies between tissues. 00:01:48And so the faster the return to alignment with the magnetization. 00:01:52So the faster they move from here to here, the stronger the signal from the photons in that tissue. 00:02:02So stronger. 00:02:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:08The signal, so the protons are turning back or realigning to orient themselves in the direction of the charge and longitudinal magnetization 00:02:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:20T2 decay, as opposed to the prior slide of T1 recovery, T2 decay is decay of transverse magnetization as the protons real  opposed to the prior slide of T1 recovery, T2 decay is decay of transverse magnetization as the protons realign. 00:02:31So the slower the decay of the transverse magnetization, the stronger the signal that is recorded at the end of this process. 00:02:39And because much of the energy has been released by the protons, T2 images are grainier and display less spatial resolution. 00:02:48So T1-weighted images are created primarily by using data from differential proton relaxation rates and the plane longitudinal. 00:02:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:59To the main magnetic field. 00:03:02The T2-weighted images primarily make use of data from differential proton relaxation rates and the plain transverse to the main magnetic field. 00:03:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:17In other words, essentially what we're  00:03:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:17In other words, essentially what we're saying is how slowly do these protons realign and how reluctant are they to release the energy they stored up from being bumped by the radio frequency signal. 00:03:32So a T1 weighted imaging and you can see table 5.1 in your McKinnis text. 00:03:37The signal is caught early, and the tissues that rapidly recover that longitudinal magnetization create a highly intense signal. 00:03:47So fat, for example, rapidly recovers longitudinal magnetization. 00:03:52Tissues that recover longitudinal magnetization more slowly, create a low signal intensity like water. 00:04:00So you should remember that fat recovers longitudinal magnetization quickly and therefore fat creates a highly intense signal on T1 imaging. 00:04:11So T1 imaging is characterized by short time to repetition. 00:04:16 1 imaging. 00:04:11So T1 imaging is characterized by short time to repetition. 00:04:16And the signal is caught early at a time when the difference in relaxation characteristics for fat and water is most noticeable, right? 00:04:24So again remember that that's going to be highly intense on T1 and water is going to be very dark 21 days. 00:04:32And so at that time, the tissues that rapidly recover that longitudinal magnetization such as fat, give out that high signal intensity and create a bright image. 00:04:45And so when a short time to echo is employed, the tissues that are slow to regain that longitudinal magnetization. 00:04:53Such as those that high water content have a really low signal intensity and those tissues appeared dark on T1-weighted images. 00:05:02So remember your T1. 00:05:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:  00:05:02So remember your T1. 00:05:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:06Fat is bright, that's a B. 00:05:10[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:13That's sort of a cheat. 00:05:14And water. 00:05:15[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:17Is. 00:05:18[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:20Dark. 00:05:22[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:26So T2 weighted imaging, again, you can refer to table 5-1 in your McKinnis text, the signal is caught late in the decay and the return to alignment process. 00:05:37So the tissues which are slowest to return to alignment, the slowest to give up the energy, those create the high signal intensity. 00:05:46  return to alignment, the slowest to give up the energy, those create the high signal intensity. 00:05:46So water is slow to give up energy therefore, the T2 high intensity signals come mostly from water. 00:05:54So if we use my sort of bad drawing arrow examples again, right? 00:05:58We have this alignment here. 00:06:01And as that alignment changes the energy is given off here. 00:06:09So in the T2, right? 00:06:11We're looking at a slow change. 00:06:16And so what we're going to see is because in the T2-weighted imaging, the signals measured really late in the decay process because it's moving really slowly. 00:06:27The tissues that are the most reluctant to give up energy are going to be selectively imaged and are going to be the brightest. 00:06:34And so water's  energy are going to be selectively imaged and are going to be the brightest. 00:06:34And so water's going to give up its energy slowly, and as a result, it's going to image with a really high signal intensity on a T2 sequence. 00:06:45So, instead, the prior slide, fat is going to give up its energy rapidly. 00:06:55And as a result on T2 imaging, it's burning fat. 00:06:59It's going to give rise to a low intensity signal and show up darker. 00:07:03So on T2 as opposed to T1, water is bright and fat, dark, okay? 00:07:21[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:26So T1 versus T2 MR imaging. 00:07:30Fat creates a high signal intensity on T1. 00:07:34Fat is bright on T1, and water creates a Understanding the pattern of pain dispersion and the number of affected joints can really inform the cause of joint pain. 00:05:49Determining joint anatomical location and understanding patterns of affected joints can help guide your identification of underlying causes of the joint pain. 00:06:00For example, both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis commonly affects certain joints, like the hips and knees, but they exhibit very different patterns and involvement of other areas. 00:06:12S is severity. 00:06:14So assessing a patient's subjective pain intensity at its worst and at its best and maybe even the current level, even though it's not diagnostic and can provide you with some critical information. 00:06:27The timing, T, understanding whether the patient's status has been worsening, improving, or remaining consistent, can also provide you with very useful information as you're beginning to examine your patient. 00:06:41[BLANK_AUDIO]  creates a high signal intensity on T1. 00:07:34Fat is bright on T1, and water creates a high signal intensity on T2. 00:07:40Water is bright T2, so in the T1 image on the left here, the bone marrow gives rise to relatively high signal intensity, and the cerebrospinal fluid gives rise to low signal intensity. 00:07:55It's black in the image, and the intervertebral discs are also dark. 00:08:01Also, note the intermediate signal intensity of the spinal cord and contrasted with the cerebrospinal fluid. 00:08:09So, again, you can see this is dark and this is dark. 00:08:17Okay, and you can also see that this. 00:08:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:24Are relatively bright compared to the disks. 00:08:26[BLANK_AUDIO]  00:08:24Are relatively bright compared to the disks. 00:08:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:29Now, in the T2 image on the right, the cerebrospinal fluid shows a high signal intensity. 00:08:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:40And with the exception of the degenerated L5S1 disc, so that's here. 00:08:45It's also a T1 image. 00:08:49The nuclei of the intervertebral disk gives rise to fairly high signal intensity so you can see the high signal intensity disc over here. 00:09:00Contrast that to the lower signal intensity on the T1 image it's important to note the anterior herniation of the L5-S1 disc, right? 00:09:12So the signal intensities from the adjacent area of bone edema and the L5-S1  00:09:12So the signal intensities from the adjacent area of bone edema and the L5-S1 vertebrae are different on T1 and T2. 00:09:22So the edema gives rise to increased signal intensity on the T2 image relative to the surrounding cancellous bone, whereas the same area in the T1 image stays dark. 00:09:36So, essentially, if we start on the T2 image and we look at that herniated region, we can see these brighter areas here, right? 00:09:43Which is indicative of more water content or edema. 00:09:47However, when we look at that same area on the right. 00:09:51Because this is going to stay dark with higher water content, we have that darker area. 00:09:56[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:02And this is a patient with rheumatoid arthritis, 56[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:02And this is a patient with rheumatoid arthritis, and so this is joint fluid, synovial hypertrophy, and this is fluid-filled erosions. 00:10:16And here we're looking at different muscles, we have the brachialis, triceps, and the capitulum of humerus, 00:10:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:27And the radial head [INAUDIBLE]. 00:10:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:37So, signal intensity is associated with inflammation and synovial hypertrophy and erosions in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis are displayed here, and the joint fluid is dark in the T1 image on the left. 00:10:53But bright in a T2 image on the right. 00:10:55Again, owing to that high 10:53But bright in a T2 image on the right. 00:10:55Again, owing to that high water content. 00:10:59The synovial hypertrophy, and the fluid-filled joint erosion also give rise to low signal when less bright areas on a T-borne image, but bright signal on T2. 00:11:10So this slice from the lateral aspect of the joint service the brachialis the triceps that could picture them of the humerus and the radial head, as I noted earlier. 00:11:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:27So here we're looking at the post laminectomy L4-5, and the top LS-4 is normal and on the bottom, the L5-S1 mortify muscle has been replaced by fat. 00:11:41And so we're looking at severe atrophy of the multifidus muscle following a lamin . 00:11:41And so we're looking at severe atrophy of the multifidus muscle following a laminectomy at the L4-5 level. 00:11:49The upper slice is made at the level of the L3-4 disc showing a normal appearance of the multifidus muscle, the lower image is made at the level of the L5-S1 does. 00:12:01And you should notice that brighter multifidi and appearance of the mortify where much of the muscle substance has been replaced by fat. 00:12:11And so because this is a T1 image you can see that that fat is very bright. 00:12:18[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:25This is a pivot shift injury, and this is a T2 image on the right side. 00:12:30And there's bone bruising, and note the high signal intensity in the posterior medial tubial plateau. 00: 12:30And there's bone bruising, and note the high signal intensity in the posterior medial tubial plateau. 00:12:38So this is a bone bruise in the medial tibial plateau of a young man who sustained a pivot shift injury while the knee was in a flexed position. 00:12:47This resulted in compression of the medial side of the joint. 00:12:51A sagittal proton density image on the left shows a slightly altered trabecular pattern. 00:12:58In the posterior aspect of that medial tibial plateau. 00:13:02Now the T2 weighted image shows increase signal intensity within this part of the marrow. 00:13:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:24So, this is an image of a runner with an overuse injury and on the top. 00:13:28And we're looking at a T1 image and on the bottom a T2  on the top. 00:13:28And we're looking at a T1 image and on the bottom a T2 image. 00:13:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:34And so the sagittal T1-weighted image top and the T2-weighted image on the bottom demonstrates how bone marrow edema is represented and the different sequences because of their T1 versus T2 imaging. 00:13:48And the overuse injuries at the medial cuneiform, represented by the closed arrow and the navicular, which is the open arrow of a young runner, show decreased signal intensities, or dark areas, on the T1-weighted image. 00:14:01So, dark areas and we contrast that with the same area and the T2 image on the bottom. 00:14:11You can see the increased signal intensity or their brightness on the fluid sensitive T2-weighted image. 00:14 11You can see the increased signal intensity or their brightness on the fluid sensitive T2-weighted image. 00:14:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:25T1 versus T2 summary, so T1 measures energy from structures which give up energy rapidly like fat after a radio-frequency pulse and T1 provides good anatomical detail. 00:14:39T2 images structures which do not give up energy easily like water, and T2 is valuable for detecting inflammation. 00:14:46So, because in T2-weighted imaging, the signal is measured late in the decay process, tissues that are most reluctant to give up energy are selectively imaged. 00:14:57Free water is slow to give up its energy, and therefore it renders a high signal intensity on T2 sequences. 00:15:05So, sat, which gives up its energy rapidly, gives rise to low signal on T2. 00:15:12 So, sat, which gives up its energy rapidly, gives rise to low signal on T2. 00:15:12[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:15:19T1 versus T2 summary continue. 00:15:24Fluid tends to be hyper intense to everything else on T2. 00:15:28Fat intensity can be unreliable because T2 images are sometimes manipulated and T1 images may use fat saturation to decrease signal from that. 00:15:38Air, cortical bone, ligaments, tendons, and other dense fibrous tissues are dark on both T1 and T2. 00:15:46T2 is valuable for detecting inflammation. 00:15:49[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:01:16Medical use of ultrasound began around the 1940s and 1950s with its ability to detect lumps in breast tissue  with very useful information as you're beginning to examine your patient. 00:06:41[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:02:26All these conditions result from systemic dysfunctions, whether hormonal, infectious, immune related, or drug induced musculoskeletal symptoms, these conditions can cause widespread musculoskeletal discomfort. 00:02:41Including limb pain, muscular weakness, stiffness or cramps. 00:02:46Nonspecific symptoms, these conditions often present with generalized nonspecific symptoms like fatigue, weight changes, fever or malaise, requiring thorough diagnostic measures to differentiate and confirm. 00:03:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:06Dizziness. 00:03:08Dizziness and vertigo are common complaints in medicine, especially in older populations. 00:03:14A precise 01:16Medical use of ultrasound began around the 1940s and 1950s with its ability to detect lumps in breast tissue. 00:01:25The diagnostic ultrasound uses the difference between the emitted and the received sound wave to allow the generation of images. 00:01:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:35So these are some examples of diagnostic ultrasound equipment. 00:01:38And ultrasound equipment is packaged in a variety of forms from laptops, to tablets, to handheld units, as you see over here on the far right. 00:01:50And the equipment cost can run from $5,000, upward of $100,000 depending on the scope of the things that it can do and the quality of images it can produce. 00:02:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:04So the ultrasound transducer, the images created by a linear transducer are rectangular over here. 00:02:14  the ultrasound transducer, the images created by a linear transducer are rectangular over here. 00:02:14And the field of view has the same diameter as the transducer. 00:02:17All right, so here's the diameter of the transducer, here's the diameter of the field. 00:02:23The curvilinear transducer, so this is curved, those images are angled, and the beam diverges, which results in a field of view that is wider than the transducer. 00:02:35So if we compare, again, here's the diameter of the linear transducer. 00:02:41Here's the diameter of the curvilinear transducer, but the diameter of this image is wider. 00:02:50So the transducer sends a ultrasound pulse into the tissues and then receives echoes back. 00:02:57And those echoes contain spatial and contrast and  a ultrasound pulse into the tissues and then receives echoes back. 00:02:57And those echoes contain spatial and contrast and intensity information. 00:03:03The transducer head can be arranged in either a linear or a curvilinear shape. 00:03:09Musculoskeletal ultrasound uses a linear array, while pelvic, abdominal, and deep structures such as the hip are usually better imaged with a transducer which is curvilinear. 00:03:21So again, that linear array transducer on the left displays a longitudinal view of the anterior hip with a field of view that's narrow and is the same as the transducer itself. 00:03:34While the curved array transducer on the right, the view widens as the distance from the transducer increases, showing not just the head of the femur, is right here, but also the neck and the proximal shaft of the femur.  the head of the femur, is right here, but also the neck and the proximal shaft of the femur. 00:03:52So this produces an image of the hip where the deeper structures appear larger than the superficial structures as a result of that divergence. 00:04:02So this slide shows some diagnostic ultrasound transducer heads. 00:04:06And transducer heads come in different shapes and sizes and are filled with different technology that allows each head to perform various functions. 00:04:14One head may operate at a range of frequencies that's completely different from another, allowing more clarity at greater or more superficial depths. 00:04:23A smaller head could allow imaging of smaller structures. 00:04:26For example, you could use it on toes or the fingers, although a larger head permits imaging of more area. 00:04:33A convex head will provide an image that looks different than a head that is straight.  area. 00:04:33A convex head will provide an image that looks different than a head that is straight. 00:04:38The other thing to keep in mind with ultrasound is that the frequencies result in different depths of imaging. 00:04:48And high frequencies will be better for superficial structures, while low frequencies will be better for imaging deeper structures. 00:04:55[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:59So the ultrasound includes a pulsar and a transducer, and the pulsar produces electrical energy in waves with different frequencies. 00:05:09And those frequencies are usually in the range of 2 to 15 megahertz, and that's referred to as the base frequency. 00:05:17And so the pulsar delivers bursts of waves at this base frequency to the ultrasound transducer. 00:05:22And between these bursts, there's nothing, but silence. 00:05:25And the sound  00:05:22And between these bursts, there's nothing, but silence. 00:05:25And the sound waves are emitted for about 1% of the examination time. 00:05:29The transducer acts as a receiver for the reflected sound waves 99% of the time. 00:05:35And so the transducer converts that electrical energy to sound energy. 00:05:41And then it delivers the ultrasound to the tissues, and it receives the reflected sound energy. 00:05:47And it converts that reflected sound energy back into electrical energy. 00:05:51[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:56So once that sound energy is converted back into electrical energy, the computer converts that electrical energy from the transducer to a digital one, and that's displayed as an image. 00:06:10The signal is amplified and noise is also reduced. 00:06:13Images are most often in grays 06:10The signal is amplified and noise is also reduced. 00:06:13Images are most often in grayscale, but Doppler imaging can actually use colors. 00:06:18[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:01:20Some of that energy is then scattered, and some is refracted. 00:01:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:25So absorption is responsible for most of the attenuation of ultrasound. 00:01:29And absorption is the result of intermolecular friction which converts mechanical energy of ultrasound to waves of heat. 00:01:40So similar to looking at an object underneath the water waves transmitted across an interface undergo a change in direction. 00:01:49And that's refraction is the second one right here like light traveling from water to air. 00:01:56 49And that's refraction is the second one right here like light traveling from water to air. 00:01:56And then reflection and scattering, scattering occurs when the reflecting surface is uneven. 00:02:02Which causes less accurate localization of structures when we're doing ultrasound imaging and less signal energy. 00:02:10Ultrasound imaging is based on reflected sound traveling from structures back to the transducer head. 00:02:17So in the reflection scattering picture on the far right, one of the things to note here is that as this purple light comes down here and hits the structure. 00:02:27Let's get these very lightly colored, dashed lines and those represent the scattering. 00:02:38So why use diagnostic ultrasound? 00:02:41Diagnostic musculoskeletal ultrasound equipment is usually portable, and sometimes it's in the form of a handheld unit as we noted before. 00:02:49And sometimes  portable, and sometimes it's in the form of a handheld unit as we noted before. 00:02:49And sometimes a tablet or a cell phone, and the setup and imaging is very quick compared to other imaging modalities like an MRI. 00:02:59So the quality of our special test isn't great. 00:03:01And in general, the information provided by most of our orthopedic special tests can be summarized by this. 00:03:07It is painful in this area. 00:03:10An image of a torn ligament or tendon, or an accumulation of fluid is information that can influence decision making quite a bit. 00:03:17Regardless of the pitfalls of over-imaging, patients we know from loads of published studies are likely to feel more satisfied with their care when they receive imaging. 00:03:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:31On the far side, that's what this study 03:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:31On the far side, that's what this study is showing. 00:03:35We look at patient value and perceptions of the overall value of an ultrasound image and sort of satisfaction. 00:03:44Most patients perceive ultrasound imaging or an image produced by an ultrasound scan as a very high value. 00:03:53So diagnostic ultrasound strengths include, you can use tenderness during palpation to guide the placement of the transducer. 00:04:02You can place the effective joint in a symptom provoking position. 00:04:06We can image while resisting motion or performing a stretch. 00:04:09You can image while testing ligament integrity, and we can image while applying traction or compression to an area. 00:04:17So here's a clinical example of ultrasound and rehabilitation, and this patient presented with right shoulder pain, rated 6 out of 10, and manual muscle 08Dizziness and vertigo are common complaints in medicine, especially in older populations. 00:03:14A precise description of the dizziness, its timeline, and associated complaints are critical in identifying a diagnosis. 00:03:21You should investigate balance and function. 00:03:24Patient's past medical history, medications and lifestyle should all be considered. 00:03:30Investigation into balance and function particularly after head and neck movements can reveal signs of dizziness such as cord compression or cervical arterial dysfunction. 00:03:40With a lack of dizziness, not ruling out the possibility of cervical arterial dysfunction. 00:03:46A patient's medical history, medications, and lifestyle should all be considered with auto toxic medications and environmental factors, neurologic red flags and information about prior medical examinations, living conditions, and functional status. 00:04:02Playing pivotal roles in your evaluation process. 00:04:05[BLANK_AUD  clinical example of ultrasound and rehabilitation, and this patient presented with right shoulder pain, rated 6 out of 10, and manual muscle testing 3 out of 5. 00:04:31And on day one, musculoskeletal ultrasound was completed, and then the patient was imaged again after three months of physical therapy. 00:04:39And the imaging suggests a reduction of fluid and the patient reported a pain rating of 1 out of 10 and muscle testing improved to 4 out of 5 without reproduction of pain. 00:04:53So some of the things that we're looking at in this image are these images. 00:04:57Day one, this is the biceps tendon. 00:05:02This means that this is the glenohumeral joint right here. 00:05:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:08And the surrounding fluid would be this black area here. 00:05:12And then the right subscap 05:08And the surrounding fluid would be this black area here. 00:05:12And then the right subscapularis tendon down here. 00:05:14And again, I think these images are meant to sort of point out this black area of this we call it hypoechoic or more fluid filled area. 00:05:29And then later on, so this was May 21st and on August 4th, we again see the biceps, tendon and less surrounding fluid. 00:05:39We see the right subscapularis tendon here. 00:05:43And again, less of that hypoechoic, that less visible area, that black sort of fluid filled area, and it's decreased in these images compared with the earlier ones. 00:05:56[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:59So diagnostic ultrasound does have some limitations. 00:06:03The field of view is limited. 00: 05:59So diagnostic ultrasound does have some limitations. 00:06:03The field of view is limited. 00:06:05There's a relatively small area that can be viewed on the screen when compared with an MRI, which can expose an entire joint or an entire region of the body. 00:06:15There's limited penetration of the field, so we're unable to penetrate bone. 00:06:20The depth of the penetration affects the resolution as well, and deeper structures are imaged at lower resolutions than more superficial structures. 00:06:29Finally, ultrasound imaging is very operator dependent. 00:06:33The value of the information gained from an ultrasound is dependent primarily on the skill and knowledge of the operator. 00:06:40The motor skills involved in manipulating the probe, combined with the knowledge of anatomy and multiple planes, are going to affect the value of the image interpretation. 00:06:51So some of the benefits of ultrasound include , are going to affect the value of the image interpretation. 00:06:51So some of the benefits of ultrasound include that it's less expensive, we can examine multiple joints to tend to have better patient tolerance. 00:07:00We can take more high resolution images as long as we're looking at more superficial structures. 00:07:05We can guide needle placement. 00:07:07And we can easily evaluate distal extremities such as the fingers or toes. 00:07:13On the right here, is an image and these are two long axis views pasted together. 00:07:19There's a complete full thickness tear of the Achilles tendon. 00:07:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:25And, what we notice here is this dark area, this sort of fluid filled areas and dark area here too. 00:07:36And the dynamic scan here also showed an absent proximal tendon movement with the  dark area here too. 00:07:36And the dynamic scan here also showed an absent proximal tendon movement with the patient actively Dorsey and plantar flex to their foot. 00:07:46Compare that to this one, here's their calcaneus, you can see the things are not so intact. 00:07:55We can see a lot of this dark region. 00:08:01Now, what we'd like to do is compare that image from an ultrasound to an MRI. 00:08:05And an MRI we can see that we can examine an entire joint. 00:08:09We can assess intraarticular cartilage easily. 00:08:12We can examine intraosseus abnormalities. 00:08:16We can look at deep structures. 00:08:18And this is much less operator dependent. 00:08:21And this is an image of a healthy Achilles tendon and calcaneus, so we can  dependent. 00:08:21And this is an image of a healthy Achilles tendon and calcaneus, so we can see how the tendon attaches here to the calcaneus 00:08:29[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:34And everything is intact, right? 00:08:36[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:40So here we're looking again at two long axis views pasted together, and we're looking at pre and post Achilles repair. 00:08:51And so again in the pre, you can see these sort of gaps down here are interruptions, that integrity of the fiber. 00:09:04And as you can see, you see this little image right here that tells us where we're imaging and the patients but so here's the calcaneus, this bright bony area. 00:09:16And we can see when we looked at the post-op images here that the tendon shows  area. 00:09:16And we can see when we looked at the post-op images here that the tendon shows much more continuity. 00:09:25And we can also see these areas where it's bunched together now because of the repair that we saw up here on top. 00:09:42You see the integrity is disrupted in multiple places. 00:09:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:49And this view down here is called a panoramic view because it glues together multiple longitudinal views to create one large continuous image, right. 00:09:59So again here's our calcaneus and now we can see here that post-op, this Achilles tendon is much more continuous versus. 00:10:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:26And this is two months postoperatively. 00:10:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:33And these images  months postoperatively. 00:10:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:33And these images are also taken two months post-op and this bottom image is from a curvilinear transducer. 00:10:39And so again if we visualize the transducer, right, we can have something. 00:10:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:47That's as this diameter, but because the transducer is convex, you get a much wider image. 00:10:58The other things to notice here are these hypoechoic regions, so these brighter regions right here. 00:11:04Those are sutures, which are bunching up. 00:11:09Jerry's keeping them all held together. 00:11:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:23Ultrasound and rehabilitation, rehabilitative ultrasound imaging or RUSI. _AUDIO] 00:11:23Ultrasound and rehabilitation, rehabilitative ultrasound imaging or RUSI. 00:11:28So RUSI is a procedure used by physical therapists to evaluate muscle and soft tissue during exercise and activities. 00:11:37So it's used to assist during interventions aimed at improving neuromuscular function. 00:11:42So, for example, we can view the low back muscles during stabilization exercises, and examine motion and space in the shoulder girdle during shoulder exercises. 00:11:51[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:02:41[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:52So, for a transverse view of the same tendon, the transducer is applied across the tendon resulting in an axial image of the tendon. 00:03:01So we can see the  is applied across the tendon resulting in an axial image of the tendon. 00:03:01So we can see the orientation of the transverse view here and here. 00:03:11So now we're looking straight down on the tendon, 00:03:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:18And so here is the axis that I'm on here. 00:03:21[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:24And so we're going to series of images that we're looking at here, number one, and here, and there's the rotator interval, right here is our humerus. 00:03:33We can begin to see the bicipital groove and number two in here represents this area is there. 00:03:44Now we can see much more of the bisects. 00:03:48The bicipital groove and the biceps tendon here, box and our biceps  status. 00:04:02Playing pivotal roles in your evaluation process. 00:04:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:10Causes of dizziness, vertigo and peripheral vestibular disorders. 00:04:15Vertigo is caused by asymmetric involvement of the vestibular system. 00:04:20Peripheral causes of vertigo involve the inner ear and nerve. 00:04:24Central causes originate in the brain, like multiple sclerosis, strokes, tumors, and migraines. 00:04:31Vertigo is caused by asymmetric involvement of the vestibular system, which includes the inner ear, vestibular nerve, brainstem, cerebellum, and cortex. 00:04:41Peripheral causes of vertigo involve the inner ear and nerve like benign paroxysmal positional vertigo BPPV, vestibular neuritis, menieres disease and acoustic neuroma. 00: ects. 00:03:48The bicipital groove and the biceps tendon here, box and our biceps tendon. 00:03:54And then in number three, this is coming across right here. 00:03:59You can see the distal biceps groove right there, and the biceps tendon right there. 00:04:06And then finally in number four, you can now see the beginning of the biceps muscle belly, you can also see the pectoralis tendon, this white area here. 00:04:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:23And so we can see here, this is the transverse view, right? 00:04:27This patient's arm going down there, the view is running 00:04:31[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:33That way, right? 00:04:35As opposed to our longitudinal view before, there's more in 04:33That way, right? 00:04:35As opposed to our longitudinal view before, there's more in this direction, okay. 00:04:44And so again in this view, this is our humorous. 00:04:47Here is our biceps tendon and then adulterated. 00:04:54[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:02And here's a view of a normal gastroc and soleus. 00:05:05And on the left is a longitudinal view here, and on the right is a transverse view. 00:05:13[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:16And so, the small foot on the image has a little yellow line, and this line demonstrates the orientation of the ultrasound transducer head. 00:05:25That's the orientation, so, what that tells us is that this is a longitudinal view 00:05:31[BLANK_AUDIO , so, what that tells us is that this is a longitudinal view 00:05:31[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:34The orientation, so this is a transverse view. 00:05:37[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:02:39Right? 00:02:40[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:42You look at the bone here, see how bright it is? 00:02:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:47That bone, right, and you can see, 00:02:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:52How that deltoid muscle, a lot of it is, 00:02:55[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:56Hyperechoic. 00:02:58[BLANK_ ANK_AUDIO] 00:02:56Hyperechoic. 00:02:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:00So structures that reflect a lot of energy are hyperechoic compared with their surrounding structures and structures that reflect very little energy are hypoechoic. 00:03:15And when structures reflect no energy, they're referred to as anechoic. 00:03:19So hyperechoic produce very bright images and waves are reflected off of hypoechoic tissues to produce really dark images. 00:03:29[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:32So, at the very top we have echoic and at the very bottom we have anechoic. 00:03:37So as we saw on the, [INAUDIBLE] right? 00:03:40So those are hyperechoic structures, and if we recall that deltoid muscle, that's more 03:40So those are hyperechoic structures, and if we recall that deltoid muscle, that's more hypoechoic. 00:03:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:57So, when we look at tissue appearances on musculoskeletal ultrasound, we can see that in general muscle is going to be interspersed with these dark spaces here that are hypoechoic. 00:04:10We see bone, and bone's going to be very hyperechoic, right? 00:04:18Very bright fluid on the other hand, it's very dark hypoechoic. 00:04:27And then we can see tendon here, tends to be much brighter, and that's the underlying bone. 00:04:33[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:37And the ligament in between there, it's also fairly dark. 00:04:42So, your bone :37And the ligament in between there, it's also fairly dark. 00:04:42So, your bone is consistently going to be your brightest area, and your fluid going to consistently be your darkest areas. 00:04:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:01And we can see that here, if we look, for example, at this bone, you can see this very bright outer shell here, like that. 00:05:14Outer area of the bone, and on the inside, no signal from the cortical bone, and you can see that right here, where I drew these arrows. 00:05:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:30And so we can see that in here. 00:05:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:42So regarding the imaging characteristics of bone, the ultrasound does not penetrate bone. 00:05:47So you have this very bright  regarding the imaging characteristics of bone, the ultrasound does not penetrate bone. 00:05:47So you have this very bright signal at the bone-soft tissue interface. 00:05:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:53And no signal is returned from the cortical bone, so the result is dark. 00:05:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:04So this is to display some of the imaging characteristics of bone and the arrows are the greater tuberosity. 00:06:12And so we have a longitudinal view of the supraspinatus, showing the smooth cortical outline of a normal humeral head on the left. 00:06:22[INAUDIBLE] 00:06:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:30And on the right, we can see these degenerative changes and a partial tear of the supraspinatus tendon. 00:06:38So here,  these degenerative changes and a partial tear of the supraspinatus tendon. 00:06:38So here, you can see how this is much less smooth, 00:06:44[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:48Than this side, 00:06:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:51Right, smooth, and not smooth. 00:06:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:59And then the tear in the supraspinatus is this area where we can see how it's darker in here. 00:07:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:11All right, so we can also see in this picture, here's the deltoid. 00:07:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:16Right up here, the greater tuberosity is this lump right there, and the junction between the tendon of the su :16Right up here, the greater tuberosity is this lump right there, and the junction between the tendon of the supraspinatus and the muscle, which is right in there. 00:07:31[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:41So the normal imaging characteristics of tendons, tendons are also hyperechoic, they're bright relative to muscle. 00:07:47Now, they're not as bright as bone, but often you can see a distinct pattern of parallel fibers in a longitudinal image and a pattern of dense spotted fibers in a transverse image. 00:08:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:06And so here we're looking at a longitudinal view of an Achilles tendon on the left side and an inflamed tendon on the right side. 00:08:15And so you would note the Achilles tendon, which is this star here, all right? 00:08:21[BLANK  so you would note the Achilles tendon, which is this star here, all right? 00:08:21[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:25And the soleus muscle, which is the X here, and thickening and inflammatory changes at the tendon were found to correspond to the area of thickening, warmth, and tenderness on palpation of this patient. 00:08:39And you should note the structural integrity of the tendon is maintained, although there's considerable inflammation within the superficial aspects, and the inflammation that you should see or you should be aware of here is this. 00:08:53We talked about how fluid is dark, so we look at this pocket and it's incredibly dark compared to the other side. 00:09:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:03This is all pretty continuous here, these fibers going through. 00:09:08And this, we can still see the fibers in there, right mal positional vertigo BPPV, vestibular neuritis, menieres disease and acoustic neuroma. 00:04:54Central causes of dizziness originate in the brain, like multiple sclerosis, strokes, tumors, and migraines. 00:05:01Differentiating central from peripheral vertigo relies on associated symptoms and exam findings. 00:05:07The quality of vertigo, presence of neurologic signs, and characteristics of nystagmus. 00:05:13[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:18The consequences, vertigo, peripheral vestibular disorders. 00:05:23Central vertigo stems from the brain, causing severe imbalance, neurologic signs, less nausea and central misdiagnosis. 00:05:32Multiple sclerosis, strokes, cranial vertebral disorders, and tumors can all cause central positional vertigo and his diagnosis. 00:05:41Strokes affect circulation causing vertigo plus other neurolog  here, these fibers going through. 00:09:08And this, we can still see the fibers in there, right, just barely, and it's just much darker, which is indicative of fluid, which suggests inflammation. 00:09:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:24And the imaging characteristics on ultrasound ligaments are also hyperechoic relative to muscle. 00:09:31So they're a little brighter than muscle, but again, a little darker than tendon and then darker than bone. 00:09:39And you should again see a distinct pattern of fibers, but a little more compact than the fibers that we would see in tendons. 00:09:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:49So here we're looking at a longitudinal view of a normal anterior talofibular ligament on the left side. 00:09:57And then the arrows indicate the fibers of the ligament extending from  ligament on the left side. 00:09:57And then the arrows indicate the fibers of the ligament extending from the fibula over here to the [UNKNOWN] over here, and you can see those fibers [INAUDIBLE] this way. 00:10:13Now the image on the right, is a torn talofibular ligament, and the arrows indicate the disruption, but the arrowhead also points to the residual stump of a torn ligament, right, so right here. 00:10:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:30This stump, and then we can see this sort of really dark area, again. 00:10:36[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:48So the characteristics of muscles on ultrasound imaging. 00:10:51Muscles are hypoechoic, so they're darker relative to the surrounding fascia or the tendons, or especially the bone. 00:11 ic, so they're darker relative to the surrounding fascia or the tendons, or especially the bone. 00:11:00And we should see fibrous bands of fascia in longitudinal views as parallel hyperechoic bands that appear brighter than the rest of the muscle. 00:11:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:13So what that means is that you have this area where things in general are pretty dark, but within that area we should see these bright bands 00:11:25[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:28And so in this picture, what we're looking at on the left is a longitudinal view of a normal gluteus medius. 00:11:37And on the right, a gluteus medius that's fibrosed. 00:11:42The fibrosis is of unknown cause, but may be linked to degenerative changes in the hip. 00:11:47What you rosis is of unknown cause, but may be linked to degenerative changes in the hip. 00:11:47What you should note here is the generally hyperechoic appearance of the fibrosed muscle, with prominent fiber strands compared to the somewhat hypoechoic normal muscle. 00:12:00And so here we see on this side on the left side, you can see how it's dark. 00:12:06And we look on the right side, we can see these really much brighter fiber strands in that muscle. 00:12:16Note the subcutaneous fat and the fascia, and the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus muscles. 00:12:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:33So the imaging characteristics of bursa. 00:12:35What we'll see is a fluid filled space, and we may see a hypoechoic line, a little bit of a brighter 'll see is a fluid filled space, and we may see a hypoechoic line, a little bit of a brighter line, and the fluid and space don't reflect sound well, so they're dark. 00:12:45And this line is between two or more hyperechoic structures, so between bone and tendon, or between tendon and muscle. 00:12:55And so what we're seeing here is the triceps and this is olecranon in this dark area. 00:13:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:08And this is a mildly inflamed olecranon bursa proximal to the elbow. 00:13:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:20So the imaging characteristics of cartilage. 00:13:22We'll see a hypoechoic layer, a really dark layer, next to a hypoechoic cortical bone, and so we see  hypoechoic layer, a really dark layer, next to a hypoechoic cortical bone, and so we see in the left here, here's the bone, and then you see this dark area right up above it. 00:13:36The thin arrows point to this cartilage, and the thick arrows point to the trochlear notch. 00:13:43So the thick arrows point to the bone and the thin arrows point to the cartilage. 00:13:49On this side over here is our lateral condyle and over here is our medial condyle, and then the star is a quadriceps tendon. 00:14:01And so on the image on the left we're looking at normal cartilage, and on the right, and we're here, we're looking at severe degeneration, and that results in this lack of space here. 00:14:12[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:25And so the  lack of space here. 00:14:12[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:25And so the imaging characteristics of nerves, and this is looking from an axial point of view and they will be hypoechoic, so a little darker relative to tendon, but a little brighter or hyperechoic relative to muscle. 00:14:39And in a longitudinal view, we'll see a striated pattern, and in a transverse view, we'll see a speckled kind of pattern. 00:14:48And FDS here is flexed digitorum superficialis. 00:14:52And flexor digitorium profundus, and the circle here is the median move, okay, and so we can see this sort of speckling. 00:15:06So this is an image of the carpal tunnel with the focus on the median nerve. 00:15:10[BLANK_AUDIO] 00  the carpal tunnel with the focus on the median nerve. 00:15:10[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:15:16And so now, look at the imaging characteristics of nerve from a longitudinal view. 00:15:22And so longitudinal scan, here on the left is a normal and on the right is a compressed median nerve. 00:15:31And so this is the longitudinal scan of the palmar aspect of the wrist on the right, you can see a ganglion, and that's this star area here and that's deep to the flexor digitorium. 00:15:45And the cyst displaces the tendon anteriorly and causes compression of the median nerve, and that's what the arrowheads are here, right? 00:15:54So in this one, we can see that the median nerve is getting compressed, and look on this one, the space is much more open, 00:16:06[BLANK  is getting compressed, and look on this one, the space is much more open, 00:16:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:16:10Okay? 00:16:10[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:01:26So a summary of indications for musculoskeletal ultrasound, bones, muscle tears, and tendon pathologies. 00:01:33So for bones, joint effusion and synovitis, some kinds of fractures, particularly long bones, degenerative or inflammatory changes at a joint. 00:01:43Muscle tears, including hamstring, gastric, biceps, etc. 00:01:48Tendon pathologies such as tears, tendinosis, tenosynovitis. 00:01:53Ultrasound can only image the cortical outline of bone, and is therefore limited when compared with CT :01:53Ultrasound can only image the cortical outline of bone, and is therefore limited when compared with CT and MRI. 00:02:01Enthesopathy, which entails roughening of bone at the attachment of tendons or ligaments, commonly associated with degenerative or inflammatory changes can generally be viewed with ultrasound. 00:02:13Regarding muscles, ultrasound is just as accurate as MRI, and additionally provides some intricate details of the muscles internal architecture. 00:02:21Ultrasound is as accurate as MRI for measuring the cross-sectional area of muscles. 00:02:26Regarding tendons, ultrasound can demonstrate the internal architecture of tendons. 00:02:32And ultrasound clearly shows the fibers within a tendon, and can therefore reveal pathological changes that aren't easily diagnosed with MRI. 00:02:41[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:46Regarding ligamentous ruptures, mononeuropathies,  cause central positional vertigo and his diagnosis. 00:05:41Strokes affect circulation causing vertigo plus other neurologic signs like dysarthria and dysphagia. 00:05:48Migraines are associated with episodic vertigo, especially in children, but the mechanism is unclear. 00:05:54[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:01Dizziness disequilibrium. 00:06:04Disequilibrium refers to dizziness and imbalance without vertigo. 00:06:08Often from dysfunction in the vestibular, somatosensory, and visual systems or central areas like the cerebellum. 00:06:15Contributing factors include aging, neurologic disease, and biomechanical constraints. 00:06:23It's assessed via posturography testing of the balanced triad somatosensory, vestibular, and visual inputs. 00:06:29[BLANK_AUD [BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:46Regarding ligamentous ruptures, mononeuropathies, ganglion cysts, and bursitis. 00:02:53We used to look at ligamentous ruptures, median and ulnar neuropathies, ganglion cysts, and bursitis. 00:03:01So regarding ligaments, the ultrasound imaging of ligaments rivals that of MRI, with the added advantages of a better display of fiber structure and the ability to perform stress tests during the examination process. 00:03:14With regards to nerves, the ultrasound could demonstrate inflammation of a nerve and changes in your diameter that indicate entrapment neuropathies 00:03:22[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:25Cysts and bursa can be viewed in great detail, including debris from adjacent joints or even thickened synovial tissue. 00:03:33[BLANK_AUD , including debris from adjacent joints or even thickened synovial tissue. 00:03:33[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:38Some of the biggest limitations of musculoskeletal ultrasound include that it's operator dependent, and then it's largely affected by how obese a patient is. 00:03:47Acoustic energy is lost in the tissue, and obtaining a correct focal length for ultrasound is problematic in obese patients. 00:03:57And compared to other imaging methods, ultrasound is more operator dependent. 00:04:02Also, structures deep to bone are not visualized, such as intra-articular ligaments and inter substance issues. 00:04:09Ultrasound isn't cross air, making it difficult to visualize structures that are obscured by air in the lungs, or gas in the intestine. 00:04:16[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | :04:16[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:02:55A yes response truly constitutes a red flag, which would require communication with another health care provider. 00:03:02Or whether it's appropriate to simply note the presence of the finding and then to monitor it over time. 00:03:08[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:03:15This is an initial review of system screening and you should be familiar with this. 00:03:19It's in your textbook in Box 9.1. 00:03:22It's basically a collection of questions and the questions are trying to be as sensitive as possible to pick up any underlying serious medical issues. 00:03:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:40If there are yes responses on the patient questionnaire, then it's important to determine if that complaint is new :03:40If there are yes responses on the patient questionnaire, then it's important to determine if that complaint is new, different, or maybe unusual for the patient. 00:03:50Is there an explanation for the change that would decrease your concern? 00:03:54Has the patient spoken about this complaint with their physician? 00:03:58If they have, has the problem become worse since they spoke with their physician? 00:04:04So if this is something new or something that's not easily explainable or it's worsened since the patient informed their physician. 00:04:11It might be worthwhile to reach out and inform the patient's physician of this change. 00:04:16Sometimes determining whether a yes represents a red flag can be very difficult. 00:04:21For example, fatigue. 00:04:22What makes fatigue a red flag when even healthy people are sometimes tired? 00:04:27Red flag parameters may help 22What makes fatigue a red flag when even healthy people are sometimes tired? 00:04:27Red flag parameters may help a little, and we'll go over those. 00:04:31[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:38So when is it important that we communicate those yes responses, that information, with the patient's physician? 00:04:45When it's something new. 00:04:47When it's something that's not easily explainable, or when it's something that's worsened since the patient first informed their physician, as we reviewed on the last slide. 00:04:55So if this is something new or not easily explainable, or it's worsened since the patient informed their physician. 00:05:00It could be worthwhile to communicate this information with that patient's physician. 00:05:04[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo 04[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:02:44Fatigue can be associated with many serious illnesses, including some psychological disorders, infections, cancers, medication use, and endocrine disorders. 00:02:55Fatigue can be challenging to differentiate when we're trying to discern between fatigue associated with normal life versus fatigue associated with some kind of serious underlying disorder. 00:03:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:12So here we'll explore some red flags associated with fatigue, and you can look at your textbook, box 9.3. 00:03:19But fatigue that interferes with the patient's ability to carry out normal activities or fatigue that lasts for more than four weeks without a clear explanation can be worrisome. 00:03:31When you're communicating with another provider, it's important to describe the specifics of the condition, including  00:03:31When you're communicating with another provider, it's important to describe the specifics of the condition, including changes in your patient's functional capacity. 00:03:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:41So an example may be that a patient says that up until three weeks ago, she typically worked eight to nine hours every day and then went home and helped take care of dinner and then was active until she went to bed at 11 PM. 00:03:53Now that same patient struggles to make it through her workday. 00:03:57She went home early from work twice this week because of her fatigue. 00:04:00And when she comes home from work, she barely makes it through dinner and has been going to bed by 9 PM. 00:04:05On the other hand, reports of pregnancy, new medication that is associated with fatigue, or recovery from illness may explain some of these symptoms and decrease the likelihood  of pregnancy, new medication that is associated with fatigue, or recovery from illness may explain some of these symptoms and decrease the likelihood of red flags. 00:04:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:24So this slide addresses the term malaise, which you'll find in your textbook. 00:04:28And some of the questions to ask regarding malaise include when did your fatigue begin and was it gradual? 00:04:35Have you noticed other unusual symptoms such as nausea, fever, loss of weight, bilateral joint pain, or early morning stiffness? 00:04:43The presence of the above symptoms may suggest malignancy, infection, or rheumatic disorder. 00:04:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:50So as an aside, when reviewing the literature, there are very limited results regarding the term malaise in PubMed and UpToDate and in other differential diagnosis textbooks that I tried to  very limited results regarding the term malaise in PubMed and UpToDate and in other differential diagnosis textbooks that I tried to look through. 00:05:03Fatigue instead is a more common non-specific symptom. 00:05:06And that being said, for your text, malaise is a sense of uneasiness or general discomfort, and quote, out of sorts, unquote feeling. 00:05:15And your text notes that patients may describe this uneasiness as an intuition that something isn't right or that they're coming down with something. 00:05:23This is different from post-exertional malaise which is an increase in severity of fatigue, weakness, dizziness, heart rate variation, temperature dysregulation following physical or cognitive exertion. 00:05:36So again, I think it's important that you understand what malaise is. 00:05:40But I think it's just as important that you  important that you understand what malaise is. 00:05:40But I think it's just as important that you understand that it's much more likely that you'll see the term fatigue used. 00:05:46[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:01:19You should also take the patient's temperature. 00:01:22It's possible that a patient does have an infection but that patient may not have a fever. 00:01:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:30In older patients especially, infections can occur in the absence of fever. 00:01:34Therefore, accompany conditions that may generate a fever include fatigue and myalgias, change in mental status, chills, sweats, tachycardia, confusion, and delirium. 00:01:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01  triad somatosensory, vestibular, and visual inputs. 00:06:29[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:34Physical examination, dizziness, presyncope. 00:06:37Presyncope is the feeling that you're about to faint. 00:06:40So symptoms might include a feeling of light-headedness. 00:06:43There's no illusion of motion like vertigo and there may be reduced cerebral blood flow. 00:06:49Cardiovascular causes include structural heart disease, coronary artery disease, and arrhythmias. 00:06:54Non-cardiovascular causes include orthostatic hypotension, hypoglycemia, hyperventilation, and possibly medications. 00:07:02[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:08These examination should include orthostatic vitals, Cardiac auscultation, ECG, and even tilt table testing. 00:07: cardia, confusion, and delirium. 00:01:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:54Red flags for fever include at least 99.5 to 101 degrees Fahrenheit for 3 weeks without discovery of a cause. 00:02:04A patient who's traveled recently, or had a recent illness or recent infection. 00:02:09Are there new skin lesions, new redness or edema? 00:02:13This could be indicative of some kind of inflammatory process. 00:02:16You should assess the heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate. 00:02:20Any abdominal tenderness may indicate appendicitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or hepatitis. 00:02:28You should communicate the temperature, the duration of the elevated temperature or fever, and any other pertinent findings with the provider. 00:02:35[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:37So three weeks  findings with the provider. 00:02:35[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:37So three weeks of a fever should account for any self-limiting viruses. 00:02:42102 degrees or higher indicates a more urgent likelihood of referral of communication with the physician. 00:02:48The physical examination should include examining the skin for lesions, again looking for redness and increased temperature or edema, which might be indicative of some kind of infection or inflammatory process. 00:03:01Consider the patient's medical history, including lymphoma, leukemia, HIV. 00:03:06A cardiac history which might include pericarditis, endocarditis, or upper respiratory illness. 00:03:13Also, nail beds could exhibit cyanosis. 00:03:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:23So, Unexplained Weight Change. 00:03:25Involuntary weight loss is more common than :23So, Unexplained Weight Change. 00:03:25Involuntary weight loss is more common than weight gain. 00:03:30It's a very sensitive but not a specific finding. 00:03:33So, some questions you might ask include, how much weight have you lost or gained, and over how long of a period? 00:03:39Do you know why you've lost or gained weight? 00:03:42Have you noticed any other new symptoms? 00:03:45If the patient has purposely changed his or her diet or increased physical activity during the time of the weight loss, then your concern can drop considerably. 00:03:53Now there's a reason or an explanation for the weight loss. 00:03:56Rapid weight gain is often associated with fluid retention, such as edema or ascites. 00:04:03And this can be a manifestation of conditions such as congestive heart failure, ema or ascites. 00:04:03And this can be a manifestation of conditions such as congestive heart failure, liver or renal disease, and preeclampsia. 00:04:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:18Red flags associated with involuntary weight loss. 00:04:23A 5 to 10% unexplained loss of body weight over 6 to 12 months can be considered a red flag. 00:04:31Malignancy, diabetes, digestive disease, thyroid disease, depression may all be associated with involuntary weight loss. 00:04:39Is the patient presenting with a cough or shortness of breath? 00:04:43It's important to take a medical history, especially in older patients, due to polypharmacy. 00:04:48Psychosocial factors should also be considered, including finances, or transport, limiting the ability to purchase groceries, an inability to prepare meals. 00:04:59You should communicate , or transport, limiting the ability to purchase groceries, an inability to prepare meals. 00:04:59You should communicate changes of weight, the time period over which those changes occurred, and any other pertinent findings to the patient's physician. 00:05:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:10A gain of five pounds or more over a one-week period during pregnancy could be a warning sign potentially associated with preeclampsia, and you should be sure to note this. 00:05:20An unexplained weight loss, as we noted above, is considered significant if it's greater than 5% of the usual body weight of the patient over a 6 to 12 month period. 00:05:29And it's often indicative of a serious medical or psychological illness. 00:05:33A slow weight decrease in the elderly is not uncommon and could be due to a lack of appetite, institutional food, disinterest in food resulting from a decreased sense of  not uncommon and could be due to a lack of appetite, institutional food, disinterest in food resulting from a decreased sense of taste or smell. 00:05:45A thorough medication history is critical, especially in elderly patients or those with chronic diseases who are on a multitude of medications. 00:05:53A psychosocial history is also crucial, especially in the elderly population, who may not be eating due to the inability to shop for groceries because of financial or transportation problems. 00:06:03An inability to prepare meals resulting from a functional limitation, or poorly fitting dentures or no dentures or a loss of appetite owing to depression or medications. 00:06:13[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:20Nausea and Vomiting. 00:06:21Please look at box 9.4 in your textbook. 00:06:25Nausea is common in normal life, and additional questions are often necessary to tease out what the  00:06:25Nausea is common in normal life, and additional questions are often necessary to tease out what the cause might be. 00:06:32Triggering events could include meals, motion, pain, etc. 00:06:36Some questions to ask your patients include, describe your nausea, is it constant? 00:06:41How frequent is it? 00:06:42Are there any new or unusual symptoms? 00:06:45Do you know why you feel nauseous? 00:06:47Have you been vomiting? 00:06:49Have you been vomiting without nausea? 00:06:51How have you been treating your nausea? 00:06:54Nausea and vomiting usually stem from GI infections but may reflect many categories or problems, including other infections. 00:07:03Actual or functional GI obstruction, metabolic disorders, central nervous system disorders, drugs, pain, pregnancy, and psychiatric disorders. 00:07  functional GI obstruction, metabolic disorders, central nervous system disorders, drugs, pain, pregnancy, and psychiatric disorders. 00:07:13Always check to see if the patient has made their physician aware of the issue. 00:07:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:22Red flags associated with nausea and vomiting. 00:07:26So nausea or vomiting associated with any change in medication, including running out of running out of medication, is a red flag. 00:07:33Vomit that is green-yellow may represent biliary colic. 00:07:37Vomit that is bile-colored may be related to intestinal obstruction. 00:07:41Vomit that appears like coffee-grounds could contain blood. 00:07:44Make sure again to communicate the onset, the frequency, vitals, presence and nature of the vomit, and any changes in medication.

consciousness accompanied by an inability to maintain postural tone, followed by spontaneous recovery, which patients often describe as fainting. 00:04:30This increases with age, especially in individuals over 70. 00:04:34Physical therapists should assess the number and frequency of falls, the duration of syncope, the span of time between episodes, patient's caloric intake, fluid intake, hydration status , the duration of syncope, the span of time between episodes, patient's caloric intake, fluid intake, hydration status. 00:04:46Any evidence of substance abuse and the patient's vital signs. 00:04:51A patient with multiple episodes occurring over a short period of time. 00:04:56In other words several days or weeks, is more likely to be suffering from a serious underlying disorder such as intermittent highgrade, atrioventricular, block peroxisomal, ventricular tachycardia etc. 00:05:10And these patients require aggressive evaluation. 00:05:13However, it is unusual for multiple syncope episodes to occur in a single day. 00:05:18Many episodes of apparent syncope each day, or episodes lasting many minutes in duration, may indicate that the patient is suffering from non syncope psychogenic disorders. 00:05:30Are what's called psychogenic pseudosyncope, or psych  non syncope psychogenic disorders. 00:05:30Are what's called psychogenic pseudosyncope, or psychogenic

particularly when the patient is less than 35 the less likely it is that the cause of syncope is life threatening unless the individual has identifiable structural heart disease. 00:05:56[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:02Syncope, prognosis and level of seriousness, the term syncope is often misapplied to seizures or other issues which are not accompanied by a transient loss of consciousness. 00:06:15Syncope is

in length. 00:02:56Addressing the underlying life stressors may be important when treating things like tension headaches. 00:03:02In summary, the literature documents  inadequate nutrient flow to the brain. 00:06:22Establishing the likely cause of this can help establish prognosis. 00:06:26Syncope during exercise or during exertion is serious. 00:06:30Syncope following exercise or after exertion is less serious. 00:06:37Neurocardiogenic syncope, also called vasovagal syncope, is a common cause of dizziness and fainting. 00:06:43And it is the result of a sudden decrease in blood pressure and heart rate after prolonged standing or through stress or by dehydration. 00:06:53It is a result of sympathetic sensitivity causing a reflexive response that suddenly causes bradycardia and venous dilation. 00:07:01The result is hypotension and dizziness. 00:07:05The timing of syncope in relation to exercise is very important, as syncope during a full flight exercise may be indicative of a serious condition  syncope in relation to exercise is very important, as syncope during a full flight exercise may be indicative of a serious condition. 00:07:15While syncope immediately after exercise tends to be more innocent and reflects an origin. 00:07:22Syncope that occurs during exertion suggests a potentially life threatening etiology. 00:07:27And this should be taken very seriously. 00:07:30On the other hand, syncope that occurs soon after the termination of exertion, for example during the cooling off, is more likely reflex in origin, similar to a vasovagal fainting. 00:07:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:49So, this chart is intended to help illustrate potential causes of syncope, and when you have time, please take a brief look through it. 00:07:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:03What I'd like you to take away from the 07:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:03What I'd like you to take away from the chart is that there are neurally mediated causes of syncope. 00:08:09There are causes of syncope that are related to orthostatic hypotension and there are cardiovascular causes of syncope. 00:08:18[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:23Determining whether pain is associated with cardiovascular pathology. 00:08:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:30So chest pain or tightness extending into the left upper extremity is typically associated with cardiovascular pathology. 00:08:37Jaw, neck, tooth, right shoulder, epigastric and midthoracic pain be refered from cardiovascular pathology. 00:08:46Pain in this locations accompanied by excessive sweating, especially in a patient with additional risk factor for cardiac disease should raise suspicion of cardiovascular origin. 00:08  by excessive sweating, especially in a patient with additional risk factor for cardiac disease should raise suspicion of cardiovascular origin. 00:08:58Pain from coronary related ischemia is more often characterized as non focal chest discomfort or pressure than pain. 00:09:07The onset is generally gradual and is exacerbated by activity. 00:09:12Discomfort that radiates particularly to either or both arms should increase suspicion for cardiovascular disease. 00:09:20A personal or family history of cardiovascular disease, older age, diabetes, dyslipidemia, cigarette smoking, hypertension, or drug use all increase the likelihood. 00:09:33Females are more likely to have associated dyspnea than males and patients who are older or have diabetes. 00:09:40I'm more likely to present with dyspnea without chest pain. 00:09:43[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:50Certain medications may cause the patient to sweat excessively. 00: 43[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:50Certain medications may cause the patient to sweat excessively. 00:09:53This chart is an example of some of those medications which include antidepressants,

onset of chest pain and pressure, a severe crushing, chest pain and pressure is described by the patient. 00:10:25Chest pain lasting more than 15 minutes. 00:10:28Pain that worsens with exertion and physical activity. 00:10:31Chest pain which is accompanied by shortness of breath, nausea, excessive sweating, or vomiting. 00:10:39Chest pain accompanied by left arm, neck or radiating jaw pain also, changes in vital signs, such as tachycardia,  accompanied by left arm, neck or radiating jaw pain also, changes in vital signs, such as tachycardia, bradycardia, or hypotension. 00:10:49When communicating with the physician, include vitals, symptoms, duration, intensity. 00:10:55Is this the initial episode? 00:10:57Is the pain constant or is it intermittent? 00:11:01The coronary arteries supply blood to the heart muscle and narrowing in one of the coronary arteries results in decreased blood supply. 00:11:10And when the lesion becomes significant, myocardial ischemia and chest pain occur. 00:11:15Any complaint of chest pain or other symptoms suggestive of ischemia should be thoroughly investigated. 00:11:22Initially, determine whether the patient is having active cardiac symptoms during the evaluation, which would require emergent transport to the closest emergency department using EMS. 00:11:34Symptoms associated with the highest  which would require emergent transport to the closest emergency department using EMS. 00:11:34Symptoms associated with the highest relative risk of myocardial infarction include radiation to an upper extremity, particularly when there is radiation to both arms. 00:11:43And pain associated with diaphoresis or with nausea and vomiting. 00:11:48An important question is whether current pain is reminiscent of prior myocardial infarction. 00:11:54Of note no one pain characteristic has sufficient positive or negative, predictive value to definitively diagnose versus fluid acute cardiac symptoms. 00:12:06[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24

auscultation may be appropriate for the physical therapist, if serious underlying pathology is suspected. 00:02:32The patient history should include a thorough analysis of the cough, including a determination of how long it has persisted. 00:02:40It's essential to identify any associated symptoms including shortness of breath, wheezing, orthopnea, fever, chills, chest pain or discomfort, sputum production, post-nasal drainage, and hemoptysis. 00:02:55The medical history should be comprehensive, with a particular focus on the potential for asthma, COPD, chronic or acute bronchitis, heart failure, GERD, or recent upper or lower respiratory infections. 00:03:12The medication history will itis, heart failure, GERD, or recent upper or lower respiratory infections. 00:03:12The medication history will not only exclude the potential for ACE inhibitor induced cough, but will also identify other problems for which medications are taken. 00:03:21The patient's prior self-treatment or prescribed treatment of cough should be explored, including the response and tolerance of the treatment. 00:03:29The patient's family history should also be established. 00:03:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:37Potential danger signs associated with a cough include fever, night sweats, purulent sputum, dyspnea, and hemoptysis. 00:03:46You should also inquire whether your patient has spoken with their physician. 00:03:51Important danger signs that we will need further evaluation with the chest radiograph and possible laboratory testing and CT include the following. 00:04:00Fevers, night sweats, or weight  radiograph and possible laboratory testing and CT include the following. 00:04:00Fevers, night sweats, or weight loss raise suspicion for chronic infection such as tuberculosis, lung abscess, or rheumatic disease. 00:04:09Purulent sputum warrants evaluation for pulmonary and possibly sinus infection, followed by treatment of identified infections. 00:04:17Hemoptysis can be an indicator of infection, such as lung abscess or tuberculosis, cancer, for example, lung, bronchus, or larynx cancer, or rheumatic diseases, heart failure, or foreign body inhalation. 00:04:32Dyspnea can be a clue to airway obstruction or a lung parenchymal disease. 00:04:38Other features such as waxing and waning versus progressively worsening symptoms, particular triggers, associated hoarseness, and focal abnormalities on examination can help focus the investigation. 00:04:50Pul  a description of how symptoms do or do not change over a 24-hour period is adequate. 00:06:20For patients with disorders such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, or head injury, the appropriate time frame may be three to six months for symptoms to change. 00:06:31If the symptom pattern reveals no consistency, then you should begin questioning whether physical therapist intervention is warranted. 00:06:40The inconsistent symptom pattern combined with location of symptoms should alert you to screen specific body symptoms later in the examination. 00:06:49However, if for example, the patient's thoracic pain increases after eating, you may begin to consider whether GI pathology is present. 00:07:01So here's an example of a sequence of questions you may ask your patient. 00:07:05Which of your symptoms is interfering most with your normal function? 00:07:10Can you explain why these symptoms may have begun? 00:07:13Describe the  underlying life stressors may be important when treating things like tension headaches. 00:03:02In summary, the literature documents cases where patients presenting to physical therapy were found to have serious undiagnosed pathology upon therapist examination. 00:03:13And this underscores the need For the therapists to be familiar with red flags. 00:03:18Providers must understand the key features distinguishing musculoskeletal conditions suitable for conservative therapy. 00:03:25Versus those requiring urgent physician referral to ensure timely diagnosis and management. 00:03:32So we've covered a framework for generating a broad differential based on symptoms that the clinician should refine using history and examination to determine the need for escalation of care. 00:03:43The medical literature contains numerous case reports of patients presenting to physical therapy with common musculoskeletal complaints like arthrology of joint pain or dizziness. 00:03:53Who were subsequently found to have a cold serious pathology upon  triggers, associated hoarseness, and focal abnormalities on examination can help focus the investigation. 00:04:50Pulmonary function testing, including pre and post-bronchodilator testing, is important to characterize the potential problem causing both dyspnea and cough. 00:05:02Immunosuppression can be a risk factor for infections such as tuberculosis, and it should prompt a diligent and rapid evaluation for infection. 00:05:10[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:17Peripheral edema is when fluid collects in the lower extremities in ambulatory patients. 00:05:23In non-ambulatory patients, it tends to collect in the sacral area. 00:05:27Non-pathologic causes include poor venous return. 00:05:31Pathological causes include heart failure, kidney disease, tumors obstructing the venous return. 00:05:38Lower extremity edema may be an , kidney disease, tumors obstructing the venous

history of blood clotting disorders. 00:06:47If the edema is bilateral, this is usually in older adults and usually chronic and related to chronic venous disease, heart failure, medications, or pulmonary hypertension. 00:06:59Acute bilateral leg edema is rare and associated with medications, acute heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, malignancy-related bilateral DVT. 00:07:  medications, acute

DVT in patients with acute unilateral or asymmetric leg edema. 00:07:20Peripheral edema can be pitting or non-pitting. 00:07:23Pitting edema is more common and is defined by the presence of tissue depression after pressure is applied to the area for at least five seconds. 00:07:33Pitting edema generally reflects the movement of the excess interstitial water in response to pressure. 00:07:39Non-pitting edema suggests lymphatic obstruction or hypothyroidism. 00:07:43[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:54Moving on to the pulmonary system checklist, I'd like you to [BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:54Moving on

00:08:55Are there any factors that seem to cause or worsen it? 00:08:59According to UptoDate, there are at least 29 potential causes of wheezing in the upper airway, the central airway, and the lower airways. 00:09:08Wheezing is an audible respiratory sound often associated with the sense of chest tightness and/or dyspnea. 00:09:15Many of the conditions included in the preceding discussions of

whether to communicate with the physician. 00:07:38At this gross overview level, information that raises suspicion of a serious underlying disorder should lead you to further more focused investigation. 00:07:47[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:57Refer to box 9.13 in your textbook, checklist used by symptom, location or pain pattern. 00:08:03Not all checklists are required for every patient. 00:08:06Recognizing a typical patterns of symptoms is important when a patient presents with pain that is not predictable. 00:08:12[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:16Certain body systems may not present with a

history of cardiovascular disease may be screened with items from the cardiovascular checklist to gather useful information pertinent to this patient. 00:08:54This may also provide a baseline which you may use to monitor progression of the disease. 00:09:00For example, if the patient reports heart problems, one of the follow up questions to ask is what symptoms do you have with your heart problem? 00:09:08Knowing that the patient has a  questions to ask is what symptoms do you have with your heart problem? 00:09:08Knowing that the patient has a history of cardiovascular disease, should

thing and not every visit. 00:09:27Just use certain portions to assess changes in the patient's status. 00:09:31New complaints may warrant using different portions of the checklist. 00:09:35It's not necessary to repeat the entire review of systems at every single visit, but at times, asking questions again at a follow-up visit is certainly appropriate. 00:09:45[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:09:51So to

disorders which may require a referral. 00:10:00The disorder you recognize and refer out may be different than the patient's chief complaint. 00:10:06You should try and minimize false alarms, but if you make a mistake, make it on the side of safety. 00:10:13Make sure and remember follow-up questions about symptoms. 00:10:17Is the patient's physician aware of the concerning symptoms? 00:10:20Is the patient providing an accurate history? 00:10:23Asking specific follow up questions about the patient's symptoms, learning whether the patient's physician is aware of the symptoms, and if the symptoms have worsened. 00:10:32And finally, judging the patient's ability to give an accurate history does this complaint represents something new, different or unusual? 00:10:40  the patient's ability to give an accurate history does this complaint represents something new, different or unusual? 00:10:40All contribute the ability to distinguish a red flag. 00:10:43[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:52In closing, musculoskeletal problems are common. 00:10:54It is easy to become centered on the area where the pain is focused. 00:10:58However, there may be underlying urgent problems requiring immediate recognition and treatment. 00:11:04Appropriate use of the review of systems may alert you to underlying serious pathology. 00:11:10Patients who have musculoskeletal problems usually present with pain, deformity or weakness. 00:11:16Joint pain in general is the most common problem, and backache specifically is the most common disorder for which patients seek health care. 00:11:23The examination is often centered on the joints where the pain is focused  for which patients seek health care. 00:11:23The examination is often centered on the joints where the pain is focused. 00:11:27But frequently, muscles and nerves are also a focal point of the examination. 00:11:33Conditions associated with joint pain can be categorized into four major groups, mechanical problems, soft tissue conditions, inflammatory diseases and non-inflammatory diseases. 00:11:43Conditions frequently associated with joint pain include osteoarthritis, tendonitis, infection, gout, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus. 00:11:53A number of presentations are indications of urgent problems requiring immediate recognition and definitive treatment. 00:12:00[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? |

low back pain, and it's an example of the information you should collect from patients presenting to you with complaints of low back pain. 00:01:49These specific items are particularly important because they may suggest that your patient's low back pain may be caused by another medical condition which is mimicking mechanical low back pain. 00:02:02The goal of red flags is to identify patients who have a higher probability of having a serious underlying medical condition and referring these patients to a physician for further examination to rule out serious medical issues that may not be treatable by standard physical therapy treatment. 00:02:19There is some evidence that you will be referred a patient with  treatable by standard physical therapy treatment. 00:02:19There is some evidence that you will be referred a patient with low back pain who has not been thoroughly screened for red flags. 00:02:26Two studies have demonstrated that primary care physicians asked about one-half to one-third of red flag identifying questions. 00:02:36In one study, only 27% of the red flag history questions were asked to patients who presented with low back pain. 00:02:43[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:50It's also important to keep in mind, though, that some findings that we call red flags are common. 00:02:57So some red flags are not an uncommon thing to stumble across. 00:03:02For example, of the 159 patient charts asking patients with low back pain whether they suffer from night or constant pain in this study, 71 of them noted a positive response. 00:03:15This doesn't mean :59That's a subspecialty of radiology. 00:04:01Looking at the musculoskeletal system, so conventional radiography or X rays. 00:04:07That's usually the first order imaging procedure after the clinical examination when we're looking for suspected musculoskeletal pathology. 00:04:16So if a patient is suspected of having a fracture, it's very likely that the x-ray will be the first choice for imaging. 00:04:25[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:29So in 1895, Willem Roentgen, that's this gentleman right here I was working in his dark laboratory in Germany. 00:04:37And he noticed that a screen that was painted with a fluorescent material and located a few feet away in the same room as a cathode ray tube started to glow. 00:04:50So this screen somewhere over here, if this room was dark, is now glowing  night or constant pain in this study, 71 of them noted a positive response. 00:03:15This doesn't mean that 71 of those 159 patients were immediately referred to their primary care provider. 00:03:22Instead, this finding is noted as important and is weighted along with the rest of the findings from the examination. 00:03:30So the specificity of quote, aged 50 and over unquote, or trauma or night constant pain in this sample of patients is not high for identifying serious underlying pathology in patients with low back pain, but it should not be ignored. 00:03:47The regular and consistent use of a thorough patient intake questionnaire form will be extremely helpful for comprehensively documenting meaningful findings including red flags. 00:03:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:04So the Do Not Want To Miss

previous functioning, with at least one of the symptoms being a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. 00:01:43The mnemonic SIGECAPS is helpful for remembering criteria for depression. 00:01:47[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:51A depressed mood most of the day nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report or an observation made by others, is criteria number one. 00:02:01Markedly

00:04:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:21Additional Information for Recognizing Major Depressive Disorder. 00:04:24Major depressive disorder is the most common mental health condition seen in primary care. 00:04:30The presentation may include mood, cognitive, neurovegetative, or somatic symptoms. 00:04:37There are limited harms associated with screening, as long as a positive screen is followed up on. 00:04:42The Patient Health Questionnaire-2 is a recommended questionnaire to use with these patients 00:04:47[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:53And this is the Patient Health Questionnaire-2. 00:04:55 _AUDIO] 00:04:53And this is the Patient Health Questionnaire-2. 00:04:55We can see that the questions are located in the top half and the scoring is the bottom half. 00:05:01And based on the score, we can assess the probability of major depressive disorder. 00:05:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:16Condition number two, suicide risk. 00:05:18In 2017, around 500,000 people saw care related to this in emergency

00:06:57Estimates are that approximately 90% of those committing suicide have a history of psychiatric illness, with most having major depression. 00:07:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:08Another factor

the affected cervical myotomes. 00:11:16But in ALS, they often appear in the legs and cranial muscles. 00:11:20Guillain-Barré and myelopathy can both present as a subacute progressive paraparesis or quadriparesis. 00:11:28Patients with Guillain-Barré typically have reduced or absent reflexes and may have cranial nerve involvement. 00:11:35While patients with myelopathy usually  reduced or absent reflexes and may have cranial nerve involvement. 00:11:35While patients with myelopathy usually have hyperreflexia and do not have cranial nerve involvement. 00:11:41[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:49So we see here, looking at cervical myelopathy up here, that age is usually over 60. 00:11:54It's usually progressive or stepwise course. 00:11:59Moderate severe cases demonstrate gait and leg spasticity or amyotrophy of the hand or arms. 00:12:05I mean diagnosis, the gold standard is generally MRI of the cervical spine. 00:12:10And then down here we look at ALS, again usually over 60 years progressive and this is pure motor syndrome, and the diagnosis is made via electromyography 00:12:23[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video?  00:12:23[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? |

but it's discovered by palpating a pulsatile mass during physical examination. 00:01:42Imaging confirmation is required for making the diagnosis. 00:01:47In this image on the right, the patient was referred to CT to scan to exclude an aortic dissection. 00:01:55Little did the patient know, contained rupture of a previously unknown abdominal aortic aneurysm was diagnosed. 00:02:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:06 ic aneurysm was diagnosed. 00:02:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:06Surgery was performed and the patient walked home two weeks later. 00:02:11Ruptured aneurysms present with severe abdominal or back pain and hypotension or shock. 00:02:16The mortality rate from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is high, 59% to 83% of patients die before they make it to the hospital or undergo surgery. 00:02:26As noted above, the operative mortality rate for those who do make it to surgery is also high. 00:02:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:38All right, so this is a pain location drawing from a real case, and I want you to note the location and description of the patient's symptoms. 00:02:47So the patient described these symptoms here as constant, and they're varying from bloated feeling 's symptoms. 00:02:47So the patient described these symptoms here as constant, and they're varying from bloated feeling with intermittent sharp and stabbing sensations. 00:02:57In their low back they describe a constant varying, deep, dull ache with intermittent throbbing sensations. 00:03:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:05.And this was at the patient's initial physical therapy visit before they were diagnosed with the abdominal aortic aneurysm. 00:03:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:18Characteristics of abdominal aortic aneurysms. 00:03:21Most individuals with abdominal aortic aneurysm have no symptoms. 00:03:27Risk factors are age, male sex, cigarette smoking, and hypertension. 00:03:32Also, trauma, syphilis, Marfan's-Ehlers-Danlos, and other connective tissue disorders, 32Also, trauma, syphilis, Marfan's-Ehlers-Danlos, and other connective tissue disorders, as well as a history of an aneurysm. 00:03:40See Box 20.8 in your textbook. 00:03:43[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:46When palpating the abdomen, a prominent lateral pulsation can give you a clue that there may be an underlying abdominal aortic aneurysm. 00:03:56To perform this palpation, the patient lies supine and the examiner places the fingertips over the epigastrium to determine if a pulse is present. 00:04:04Both hands are placed on either side of the aorta to help determine the aortic width. 00:04:09A positive test is that the abdominal aorta is greater than three centimeters in width. 00:04:17So age and male gender are important risk factors because the a is greater than three centimeters in width. 00:04:17So age and male gender are important risk factors because the prevalence of AAA is five to six times greater in men than women. 00:04:25A history of smoking carries at three to five times greater risk for developing a AAA. 00:04:30The effect of smoking plus age consideration was demonstrated by a study inviting men aged 65 to 74 years of age, with a lifetime consumption of smoking more than 100 cigarettes into AAA screening. 00:04:43It was estimated that eliminating the smoking would result in 89% reduction in abdominal aortic aneurysm related deaths in this age group. 00:04:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:59So palpation for abdominal aortic aneurysm has a sensitivity of 68 and a specificity of 75 likelihood ratio of 2.7. 00:05:09And accuracy is improved by smaller patient waist size and larger aneur  likelihood ratio of 2.7. 00:05:09And accuracy is improved by smaller patient waist size and larger aneurysm size. 00:05:15The ability to palpate will depend on the patient's body morphology. 00:05:19Detecting a AAA with palpation, again, is a 68 percent sensitivity. 00:05:24A waist size less than 100 centimetres and larger aneurysms, meaning aneurysms greater than 5 centimetres, increase the sensitivity. 00:05:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:34So once a pulse has been detected with mid abdominal palpation, the PT places fingertips with deep and gentle pressure along the sides of the pulse, noting the presence of a laterally expansive pulsation. 00:05:47Such a finding what further worn abdominal auscultation are brewing keep in mind the sensitivity on this is not great and very dependent on body morphology. 00:  auscultation are brewing keep in mind the sensitivity on this is not great and very dependent on body morphology. 00:05:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:05Deep vein thrombosis. 00:06:07Consider a vascular origin for any leg pain that is not musculoskeletal in nature. 00:06:13A patient with arterial insufficiency may describe pain that increases with exercise and decreases with rest. 00:06:20A patient who may be suffering from venous insufficiently may describe pain as gradual and onset. 00:06:26It may be delayed, and may have greater variability. 00:06:29It could be constant from hours to days. 00:06:32It also may be life-threatening in the form of thrombophlebitis, or pulmonary embolism. 00:06:3850% of DVTs are asymptomatic in the early stages.  and they could do things like kill germs and improve beauty. 00:06:32But exposure to radiation had consequences. 00:06:37And by World War I, there was a very popular image of a radiologist, and that image included a gloved or an amputated hand, which was a result of that hand being exposed to x-rays, right? 00:06:52But even as those x-rays became combined to medical settings, they're is still used and coin operated Foot-o-Scopes which were used for looking at feet all the way up until after World War Two. 00:07:06And then in 1957 Pennsylvania became the first state to ban the use of those Foot-o-Scopes. 00:07:13[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:07:14We can see one of those over here Foot-o-Scope. 00:07:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:24  pulmonary embolism. 00:06:3850% of DVTs are asymptomatic in the early stages. 00:06:43Pain or weakness that occurs in the calves and sometimes the thighs or the buttocks with exercise and then dissipates at rest is most likely related to peripheral vascular disease. 00:06:56Intermittent claudication is pain that comes on rapidly during exercise and then is relieved by rest. 00:07:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:05In your textbook, please see box 20.9 for DVT risk factors. 00:07:10And we can see on the table on the right here that there are a number of causes for the development of venous thrombosis. 00:07:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:22Regarding the history, it's very important to ask if there's a history of previous blood clots in the lower extremities. 00  history, it's very important to ask if there's a history of previous blood clots in the lower extremities. 00:07:29Ask about other blood clotting disorders, recent trauma to the legs, history of abdominal cancers, prolonged immobility or travel, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, chronic spinal conditions, paraesthesia. 00:07:43Lower extremity weakness or calf pain, especially during walking or exercise. 00:07:49Physical examination should include examination of temperature, color, condition of the skin, the presence of arterial pulses and the lower extremities, calf redness or edema. 00:08:01Sensation testing reflexes and note any discomfort with ambulation. 00:08:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:11So again for the physical examination, and a patient you suspect may be suffering from a DVT. 00:08:17Assess the temperature, color and condition of the skin,  may be suffering from a DVT. 00:08:17Assess the temperature, color and condition of the skin, assess the presence of pulses in the lower extremities. 00:08:24Look for calf redness or edema. 00:08:26Test sensation and reflexes and note any discomfort with ambulation. 00:08:31[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:39The Wells' criteria for DVT You should only apply the Wells criteria after the history and physical examination is suggestive of a DVT. 00:08:48Recognize the importance of pretest probability, unilateral leg pain, redness, swelling, edema, warmth, tenderness. 00:08:57Age over 55 and history of bed rest or immobility all increase the probability. 00:09:03In terms of physical findings, a difference in calf circumference, dilated superficial veins, unilateral warmth, tenderness, erythema, pain  findings, a difference in calf circumference, dilated superficial veins, unilateral warmth, tenderness, erythema, pain and tenderness along the course of involved major veins and local mass. 00:09:18Or signs of malignancy are also suggestive of DVT. 00:09:23From Dr. Wells regarding his scores, the model should be applied only after a history and physical suggests that DVT is a diagnostic possibility. 00:09:32It should not be applied to all patients with chest pain or dyspnea or all patients with leg pain or swelling. 00:09:39This is the most common mistake that's made with the Wells criteria. 00:09:43A larger calf circumference is the most usual finding. 00:09:46One meta-analysis reported that patients with a difference in calf circumference were twice as likely to have a DVT. 00:09:54Holman's sign, calf pain on passive dorsiflexion of  to have a DVT. 00:09:54Holman's sign, calf pain on passive dorsiflexion of the foot, is unreliable for the presence of DVT. 00:10:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:06So this is the Wells score. 00:10:09And we can see clinical features are each given a score of one at their present. 00:10:13So active cancer, paralysis, creases or recent plaster immobilization of the lower extremities. 00:10:19Recently bedridden for more than three days or major surgery within four weeks, localized tenderness along the distribution of the deep venous system, entire swelling of a leg. 00:10:29Calf swelling by more than three centimeters when compared to the asymptomatic leg. 00:10:36Pitting, edema, collateral, superficial veins, and an alternative diagnosis as likely or more likely than that of DVT would itting, edema, collateral, superficial veins, and an alternative diagnosis as likely or more likely than that of DVT would result in subtracting two points. 00:10:46And then this results in suspicion of high probability, moderate probability, or low probability. 00:10:54There's also a modification here. 00:10:56And that modification includes taking into account a previously documented DBT. 00:11:04So patients may be assigned to one of three risk categories, high, moderate, and low, but it's also acceptable to use two categories, unlikely or likely. 00:11:14[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:02:54Any progressive loss of strength? 00:02:56Any increasing frequency of tripping, or have you experienced a fall recently? 00:03:02Asking the patient about any other complaints like nausea pping, or have you experienced a fall recently? 00:03:02Asking the patient about any other complaints like nausea, fever, abdominal pain, upper back, or shoulder pain could be useful for suggesting follow-up questions or screening to rule out serious pathology. 00:03:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:17Overlapping pain patterns, and one of the important things that you'll see frequently here in these presentations is to see a specific table and this one is table 5.1 in your book. 00:03:30Your book also includes a number of boxes and figures and I'll refer to those quite often. 00:03:38It just seems to be the the format of the book and that's how the author put it together. 00:03:43Lots of tables, lots of figures, lots of boxes. 00:03:48So there's considerable overlap between pain referred from musculoskeletal structures and pain associated  boxes. 00:03:48So there's considerable overlap between pain referred from musculoskeletal structures and pain associated with visceral disorders. 00:03:57Certain pain descriptions may be unusual for musculoskeletal pain. 00:04:02So vascular disorders could present with a patient complaining of throbbing or pounding or pulsating kinds of symptoms. 00:04:09Neurologic disorder could present with symptoms that a patient might describe as sharp or shocking or burning. 00:04:18And visceral disorders could present with symptoms such as aching, squeezing, gnawing, burning or cramping. 00:04:26The symptom descriptions alone don't really contain enough information to diagnose or base any kind of referral. 00:04:32Knowledge of potential pain location patterns associated with viscera can guide the PT and selecting the organ systems to screen further with questions related to a review of symptoms. 00:04:44Symptom onset,  the organ systems to screen further with questions related to a review of symptoms. 00:04:44Symptom onset, so information about when the symptoms began should be obtained. 00:04:51And is this the episode that started everything? 00:04:55Is there a multi year history? 00:04:57Can the patient point to a specific inciting event? 00:05:00So many patients cannot relate the onset of their symptoms to any particular incident or accident. 00:05:07However, if you question them carefully, you can often uncover a likely cause, such as the patient beginning to run after not having run for three months, or being promoted to some kind of position that requires sitting at a desk for eight hours a day. 00:05:21Or starting to return to gardening, or yard work after the winter. 00:05:26If the onset of symptoms is truly insidious, if new symptoms occur during the course of treatment, or if :05:26If the onset of symptoms is truly insidious, if new symptoms occur during the course of treatment, or if resolved symptoms return for no apparent mechanical reason, then you should begin having some questions about the underlying nature of the condition. 00:05:44[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:47Behavior and pattern of symptoms. 00:05:49So has the intensity of the symptoms changed over time? 00:05:54Are symptoms affected by activity versus rest, or by the patient's position, or the time of day? 00:06:01Is the behavior of the symptoms generally predictable over a 24-hour period? 00:06:06So for many patients with neuromusculoskeletal disorders, a description of how symptoms do or do not change over a 24-hour period is adequate. 00:06:20For patients with disorders such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, or head injury, the appropriate time frame may be three  over here Foot-o-Scope. 00:07:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:24So, in the 1910s and 20s, the military was using x-rays to screen for tuberculosis via chest x-rays. 00:07:33The military was also using x-rays to examine bullet wounds and fractures. 00:07:39And military was very active during that time, driving trucks with portable x-ray units. 00:07:47And then we have the development of diagnostic ultrasound and that evolved from sonar technology. 00:07:55And in the 1920s and 30s nuclear medicine development continued and still there wasn't much consideration given to radiation exposure. 00:08:05And in fact, the average age of death around that time for a radiologist was about 56 years old, Marie curie's notebooks are still radioactive today. 00:08:16So in 1945, the detonation of atomic bombs generated more 06:20For patients with disorders such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, or head injury, the appropriate time frame may be three to six months for symptoms to change. 00:06:31If the symptom pattern reveals no consistency, then you should begin questioning whether physical therapist intervention is warranted. 00:06:40The inconsistent symptom pattern combined with location of symptoms should alert you to screen specific body symptoms later in the examination. 00:06:49However, if for example, the patient's thoracic pain increases after eating, you may begin to consider whether GI pathology is present. 00:07:01So here's an example of a sequence of questions you may ask your patient. 00:07:05Which of your symptoms is interfering most with your normal function? 00:07:10Can you explain why these symptoms may have begun? 00:07:13Describe the symptoms, do the symptoms spread to any other body, regions or parts? 00:07:19Please

activities. 00:04:43Slip capital femoral epiphysis occurs in adolescents and 2-1 in boys vs girls. 00:04:51Symptoms include groin, thigh or knee pain and limited hip internal rotation range of motion. 00:04:58Pathologic fractures of the femoral neck occur secondary to disease and often in the absence of major trauma. 00:05:05These fractures are most common in individuals over 50 years, women more often than men, and patients who have a history of metabolic bone disease, such as osteoporosis or Paget's disease. 00:05:18A history of a fall from a standing position is often oporosis or Paget's disease. 00:05:18A history of a fall from a standing position is often reported, along with a feeling of a sudden painful snap in the hip region and giving way. 00:05:26Acute groin pain is usually reported. 00:05:30In Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, this condition results from an idiopathic loss of blood supply From the lateral ascending cervical artery to the femoral head. 00:05:40Patients with osteonecrosis and Legg-Calve-Perthes disease often report pain in the groin, thigh, and knee that worsens with weight-bearing activities resulting in an antalgic gait. 00:05:52Common clinical findings

00:06:30Peripheral vascular disease often includes aching and buttock thigh and calf that increases with activity and improves with rest. 00:06:39A DVT may manifest as calf pain that increases with

00:07:16Compartment syndrome is a result of swelling inside a connective tissue compartment. 00:07:21Usually it's a result of trauma or a rapid increase in physical activity. 00:07:26Symptoms of compartment syndrome include pain when a stretch is applied to the involved muscle. 00:07:32Keep in mind the six Ps of compartment syndrome, pain, palpable tenderness, paraesthesia, paresis, pallor,

reveals swelling, tenderness and palpable tension of the involved compartment. 00:07:52The nerve entrapment or compression found in this condition results in paresthesias, and potentially in paralysis. 00:07:59The vascular compromise accompanying this condition results in diminished peripheral pulses and, potentially, a change in skin color. 00:08:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:14Finally, septic

involved, erythema may be present. 00:08:44Patients who develop septic arthritis often are immunosuppressed or have pre-existing systemic joint disease. 00:08:54An infection in the tissues, cellulitis, exhibits the classic signs of pain, skin swelling, warmth. 00:09:01And advancing irregular margin of erythema or reddish streaks, suspicion of either septic arthritis or cellulitis would

increase the likelihood of brain tumor as a source of pain. 00:03:28Subarachnoid hemorrhage may result in headache, meningeal irritation, fever, photophobia, nausea, vomiting, or neurologic

late-stage, untreated bacterial and tuberculosis meningitis. 00:04:13A recent study involving 297 adults with suspected meningitis revealed the positive likelihood ratio of 0.97, as I mentioned above. 00:04:23And it did not accurately discriminate between patients with and without meningitis. 00:04:29The test demonstrated diagnostic value in only four patients who had severe meningeal inflammation. 00:04:36Instead, a headache that worsens after horizontally rotating the head at a frequency of two to three times per second may be more sensitive with a sensitivity up to 0.97. 00:04:50Regarding

00:08:16So in 1945, the detonation of atomic bombs generated more interest in the effects of exposure to radiation. 00:08:25And in the 50s and 60s, effective dose limits began to be talked about and what that meant was that there became this recognition that no dose exists below which the risk of damage does not exist. 00:08:40So, the idea was to keep the dose as low as reasonably achievable right here ALARA as low as reasonably achievable. 00:08:55So in the 1970s computer-heated tomography permitted cross-sectional images. 00:09:01And a single slice of image took around 4.5 minutes of

morbidity from hand infections. 00:04:21So diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or malignancy, all affect morbidity. 00:04:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:29You want to take patient vital signs and expose the entire upper extremity for examination if you suspect an infection. 00:04:36Epitrochlear and axillary lymphadenopathy often accompany a forearm infection. 00:04:41[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:43We mentioned above, occupation, the patient's occupation may increase their exposure to certain infectious agents. 00:04:51An animal handler may be prone to bite wounds that may become infected with organisms typical for involved species. 00:04 :51An animal handler may be prone to bite wounds that may become infected with organisms typical for involved species. 00:04:57A rose gardener, for example, is at risk for infection through the introduction of spores through a cut or puncture wound in the skin. 00:05:05Certain professions are more prone to chronic paronychia. 00:05:09As an example, dishwashers are likely to develop candida infections, whereas a person employed in a tropical fish aquarium is more likely to develop another kind of infection after a hand injury, mycobacterium. 00:05:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:29And here are two images of infection. 00:05:32On the left is erythema following a catfish sting and a subsequent infection. 00:05:37And we can see here the redness, the area of erythema. 00:05:42And this right And we can see here the redness, the area of erythema. 00:05:42And this right here is the puncture wound from the catfish sting. 00:05:46So on the right, this photograph demonstrates a dorsal subcutaneous abscess. 00:05:52Note that the abscess is pointing, meaning that the skin is starting to thin from the pressure of the fluid underneath it. 00:05:59And this indicates an impending rupture of the abscess. 00:06:03So, I can see this, 00:06:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:07Whole area, and this is the pointing of the abscess. 00:06:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:18So this is another image of infection in the elbow, wrist, and hand. 00:06:25And this is an example of skin necrosis with MRSA infection. 00  wrist, and hand. 00:06:25And this is an example of skin necrosis with MRSA infection. 00:06:29[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:38Infection, diagnosing most hand infections. 00:06:41The majority of hand infections can be diagnosed on clinical examination based on the presence of pain, erythema, abnormal swelling, or drainage. 00:06:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:55Raynaud's disease or Raynaud's phenomenon. 00:06:58This is an exaggerated vascular response to cold or emotional stress. 00:07:03Note color changes of the skin and fingers. 00:07:07Raynaud's can be secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis. 00:07:13It's more common among young females and in families with a history of Raynaud's. 00:07: :13It's more common among young females and in families with a history of Raynaud's. 00:07:18[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:23Raynaud's diagnostic criteria, there are no simple tests or diagnostic criteria that can be used to diagnose Raynaud's. 00:07:30The following questions, however, may be helpful. 00:07:33Asking your patient, are your fingers unusually sensitive to cold? 00:07:38Do your fingers change color when exposed to cold? 00:07:42If the fingers change color, do they turn white, blue/purple, or both? 00:07:47[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:51So this is a flowchart of diagnosis of Raynaud's, and it starts with asking, has a typical episode of Raynaud's phenomenon been witnessed by a clinician or shown to the clinician in photographs or a video  typical episode of Raynaud's phenomenon been witnessed by a clinician or shown to the clinician in photographs or a video? 00:08:04A typical episode of Raynaud is characterized by the following. 00:08:07A sudden onset of cold fingers or toes, an association with sharply demarcated color changes of skin color, followed by cyanotic skin, so a white attack followed by a blue attack. 00:08:19With re-warming ischemic phase, wider blue attack usually last 15 to 20 minutes. 00:08:26The skin subsequently blushes and turns red or pink upon recovery. 00:08:31So, if this has occurred, you want to evaluate for possible secondary causes of Raynaud's phenomenon. 00:08:39If it has not occurred, then you want to ask the patient the following questions, and those are what we mentioned above. 00:08:45Are your fingers unusually sensitive to cold? 00  following questions, and those are what we mentioned above. 00:08:45Are your fingers unusually sensitive to cold? 00:08:48Do your fingers change color when exposed to cold? 00:08:50If your fingers change color, do they turn white, blue, or both? 00:08:56So fingers are unusually sensitive to cold, but not associated with color changes, that's unlikely Raynaud's phenomenon. 00:09:02If fingers change color when exposed to cold, that's possible Raynaud's phenomenon, if the changes are uniphasic. 00:09:11If the fingers change color when exposed to cold and the changes are biphasic, then we can presume it's Raynaud's, and we evaluate for secondary causes of Raynaud's. 00:09:22So it's a very complex flowchart, 00:09:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:26I don't  very complex flowchart, 00:09:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:26I don't expect you to memorize all this. 00:09:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:30So this is a picture of a typical episode of Raynaud's. 00:09:34And on the left, we see that pallor in several fingers. 00:09:38And on the right, we see the cyanosis at the fingertips 00:09:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:50Complex regional pain syndrome, CRPS. 00:09:53CRPS is a disorder, usually affecting the distal limbs and is characterized by pain, swelling, limited motion, vasomotor instability, skin changes, and patchy bone demineralization. 00:10:08The onset is often after a fracture or surgery. 00:10:10The pathogenesis is unknown. 00 , MRI was approved for clinical use. 00:09:18Right here, in the 1990s, functional MRI changed the way we can view the chemical composition of the brain. 00:09:30And after that charged-coupled devices began to translate light to images, and we were able to convert film-based to digital imaging. 00:09:42And then picture archiving and communication systems, PACS, allowed the storage and the viewing and filing and transmission of images so that. 00:09:52A whole network of clinicians could have immediate access to an image. 00:09:57Computer-assisted diagnostics and pattern recognitions 00:10:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:04Began to pick up, and those are still being developed today. 00:10:07But humans are still better at identifying harmful non-normal kinds of images. 00:10:14But things like image-guided surgery continue to progress 10:08The onset is often after a fracture or surgery. 00:10:10The pathogenesis is unknown. 00:10:13Pain is the most prominent and debilitating symptoms. 00:10:15[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:18There are often other symptoms, and various types of sensory abnormalities are common in CRPS. 00:10:23About two-thirds of patients with CRPS have functional motor impairments related to pain. 00:10:29Impairment is typically manifested by a reduction of complex muscle strength and hand grip, or during standing on your toes. 00:10:37Limb movement may be limited by edema, pain, or contractures. 00:10:41Some patients develop central motor manifestations such as tremor, myoclonus, dystonic postures, or impaired initiation of movement. 00:10:52Autonomic changes can also occur, and that includes differences in skin temperature, skin  initiation of movement. 00:10:52Autonomic changes can also occur, and that includes differences in skin temperature, skin color, sweat, or edema, these are common. 00:11:01Skin changes can affect the connective tissue in CRPS. 00:11:05And those may include increased hair growth, increased or decreased nail growth, contraction and fibrosis of joints and fascia, as well as skin atrophy. 00:11:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:20So we would consider CRPS if the following symptoms are present. 00:11:25Number 1, pain, sensory changes, motor symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, or trophic changes, which develop after limb trauma, usually within four to six weeks. 00:11:37Number 2, the symptoms are no longer fully explained by the initial trauma. 00:11:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:43And number 3,  the initial trauma. 00:11:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:43And number 3, the symptoms affect the distal limb, they go beyond the region involved in the trauma, or they extend beyond the territory innervated by a single nerve or nerve root. 00:11:54There is a more elaborate set of criteria compared to the three above, which includes possible imaging, and the clinical diagnostic criteria are comprised of the Budapest consensus criteria. 00:12:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:10CRPS and patient history. 00:12:13Is the patient history consistent with a neurological or musculoskeletal issue that may respond to physical therapy treatment? 00:12:20Does it make sense to you or does it seem off? 00:12:24Given the patient history, have you decided whether other body systems or body regions, upper or lower quadrant, should be screened in addition? 00:  have you decided whether other body systems or body regions, upper or lower quadrant, should be screened in addition? 00:12:33The location of symptoms may alert you to warning signs for serious disorders. 00:12:38Specific medical screening questionnaires and questions related to patient history will help you collect valuable information. 00:12:46[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:02:54Just like the last slide, paying attention to patient demographics and symptom patterns can give you a clue regarding differential diagnoses. 00:03:05Factors may include family history, health history, and viral infections. 00:03:11The presence of family history can be a significant risk factor, often seen in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. 00:03:21Health history is another ondylitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. 00:03:21Health history is another critical component for a disease risk assessment, with lots of conditions tied to specific background risks, such as joint infection and autoimmune disorders. 00:03:32Viral infections, sunlight exposure, and the use of certain medications can all contribute to systemic lupus erythematosus. 00:03:41And this illustrates the complexity of health history as a risk determiner. 00:03:46The patient's symptom description. 00:03:48Important information can be learned just from a patient's description of their symptoms. 00:03:53A mnemonic O.P.Q.R.S.T can help you organize your approach to a patient's chief complaint. 00:04:02So a comprehensive examination of a patient's primary complaints involving details about the area and the nature of symptoms, the onset, aggravating and relie  examination of a patient's primary complaints involving details about the area and the nature of symptoms, the onset, aggravating and relieving factors, and daily pain variations can be crucial to informing your understanding of the patient's health status. 00:04:20With common symptomatic patterns and assumptions underpinning therapy approaches. 00:04:26So the mnemonic OPQRST symptom description, O is onset of symptoms, and then P is provocation and palliative, Q is quality. 00:04:37R is region and radiation, S is severity, and T is timing. 00:04:43So with O, the approach to a patient interview often involves starting with open-ended questions, followed by questions with increasing focus. 00:04:53The P is identifying what exacerbates or alleviate the patient's symptoms, and this can be very important for diagnosis and treatment. 00:05:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:03Q is  important for diagnosis and treatment. 00:05:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:03Q is requiring a detailed description of a patient's pain and a comprehensive 24-hour report because this can indicate specific conditions. 00:05:13For example, gout is often characterized by a sudden onset and nighttime attacks while rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis often include extensive morning stiffness. 00:05:24And osteoarthritis might involve mild to moderate morning stiffness that relieves within 30 minutes of activity. 00:05:32But it could also present with nighttime discomfort. 00:05:36R, identifying the specific affected area, right, the region and radiation. 00:05:42Understanding the pattern of pain dispersion and the number of affected joints can really inform the cause of joint pain. 00:05:49Determining joint anatomical location and understanding patterns of affected joints can help guide your identification of underlying . 00:05:49Determining joint anatomical location and understanding patterns of affected joints can help guide your identification of underlying causes of the joint pain. 00:06:00For example, both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis commonly affects certain joints, like the hips and knees, but they exhibit very different patterns and involvement of other areas. 00:06:12S is severity. 00:06:14So assessing a patient's subjective pain intensity at its worst and at its best and maybe even the current level, even though it's not diagnostic and can provide you with some critical information. 00:06:27The timing, T, understanding whether the patient's status has been worsening, improving, or remaining consistent, can also provide you with very useful information as you're beginning to examine your patient.

00:03:30Investigation into balance and function particularly after head and neck movements can reveal signs of dizziness such as cord compression or cervical arterial dysfunction. 00:03:40With a lack of dizziness, not ruling out the possibility of cervical arterial dysfunction. 00:03:46A patient's medical history, medications, and lifestyle should all be considered with auto toxic medications and environmental factors, neurologic red flags and information about prior medical examinations, living conditions, and functional status. 00:04:02Playing pivotal roles in your evaluation process.

different treatments. 00:10:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:34So medical images that were stored on film really have acquired an incredible amount of space for storage in a facility and in addition, a film could only be at one location at any time. 00:10:47And so this meant that there were times when a film might be needed to help determine the care for a patient, but that film may not be available at that location. 00:10:57So now studies are maintained on servers where images can be archive. 00:11:02They can be transmitted or communicated to others, and they can be stored BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:10Causes of dizziness, vertigo and peripheral vestibular disorders. 00:04:15Vertigo is caused by asymmetric involvement of the vestibular system. 00:04:20Peripheral causes of vertigo involve the inner ear and nerve. 00:04:24Central causes originate in the brain, like multiple sclerosis, strokes, tumors, and migraines. 00:04:31Vertigo is caused by asymmetric involvement of the vestibular system, which includes the inner ear, vestibular nerve, brainstem, cerebellum, and cortex. 00:04:41Peripheral causes of vertigo involve the inner ear and nerve like benign paroxysmal positional vertigo BPPV, vestibular neuritis, menieres disease and acoustic neuroma. 00:04:54Central causes of dizziness originate in the brain, like multiple sclerosis, strokes, tumors, oma. 00:04:54Central causes of dizziness originate in the brain, like multiple sclerosis, strokes, tumors, and migraines. 00:05:01Differentiating central from peripheral vertigo relies on associated symptoms and exam

00:05:23Central vertigo stems from the brain, causing severe imbalance, neurologic signs, less nausea and central misdiagnosis. 00:05:32Multiple sclerosis, strokes, cranial vertebral disorders, and tumors can all cause central positional vertigo and his diagnosis. 00:05:41Strokes affect circulation causing vertigo plus other neurologic signs like dysarthria and dysphagia. 00:05:48Migraines are

00:06:01Dizziness disequilibrium. 00:06:04Disequilibrium refers to dizziness and imbalance without vertigo. 00:06:08Often from dysfunction in the vestibular, somatosensory, and visual systems or central areas like the cerebellum. 00:06:15Contributing factors include aging, neurologic disease, and biomechanical constraints. 00:06:23It's assessed via posturography testing of the balanced triad

00:06:37Presyncope is the feeling that you're about to faint. 00:06:40So symptoms might include a feeling of light-headedness. 00:06:43There's no illusion of motion like vertigo and there may be reduced cerebral blood flow. 00:06:49Cardiovascular causes include structural heart disease, coronary artery disease, and arrhythmias. 00:06:54Non-cardiovascular causes include orthostatic hypotension, hypoglycemia, hyperventilation, and possibly medications. 00:07:02[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:08These examination should include orthostatic vitals, Cardiac auscultation, ECG, and even tilt table

the need For the therapists to be familiar with red flags. 00:03:18Providers must understand the key features distinguishing musculoskeletal conditions suitable for conservative therapy. 00:03:25Versus those requiring urgent physician referral to ensure timely diagnosis and management. 00:03:32So we've covered a framework for generating a broad differential based on symptoms that the clinician should refine using history and examination to determine the need for escalation of care. 00:03:43The medical literature contains numerous case reports of patients presenting to physical therapy with common musculoskeletal complaints like arthrology of joint pain or dizziness. 00:03:53Who were subsequently found to have a cold serious pathology upon examination by the therapist. 00:04:00It's important for providers to be aware of the risk  cold serious pathology upon examination by the therapist. 00:04:00It's important for providers to be aware of the risk factors clinical features and patterns of presentation that could distinguish musculoskeletal conditions. 00:04:09That may be treated conservatively through physical therapy from those requiring urgent or emergent physician referral. 00:04:17An understanding of red flag pathology is critical to ensure timely diagnosis and management of potentially life threatening disease processes. 00:04:26This information presented here and in your textbook provides a framework for generating differential diagnoses based on the patient's reported symptoms. 00:04:35The onus is then on the clinician to corroborate or refute elements of that differential based on a careful history taking and physical examination. 00:04:44Any findings suggestive of serious pathology should prompt you to escalate care and immediately consult with the appropriate medical specialists. 00:04:53[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s  appropriate medical specialists. 00:04:53[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:01:30Well as we just stated, PTs receive education in basic sciences like anatomy. 00:01:37And we also have an education that's clinical, and we have an applied science education. 00:01:45And so we should have the confidence and the tools to be able to communicate effectively with radiologists to get additional information from looking at images on their own. 00:01:58So, imaging provides a more comprehensive evaluation. 00:02:03And so, when you're examining a patient, that patient history and the physical findings can be supplemented by imaging. 00:02:11When that's necessary to provide a more thorough understanding of any kind of underlying pathological process. 00:02:19But it can also help illuminate maybe the absence of some sort of underlying  kind of underlying pathological process. 00:02:19But it can also help illuminate maybe the absence of some sort of underlying process that you might have thought was going on but isn't. 00:02:30And finally, a physical therapists could be looking for information from imaging. 00:02:37That's not the same as the kind of information that a physician might be looking for. 00:02:42So we can imagine a case where maybe there's a bony malunion and that may change our treatment goals and our interventions. 00:02:53Know for example, what we may be able to expect in terms of range of motion. 00:02:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:02So what is radiology? 00:03:04Well, radiology is investigating or exploring the use of radiant energy and where do you active materials to diagnose, treat and prevent disease? 00:03:18So radiology is generally the  where images can be archive. 00:11:02They can be transmitted or communicated to others, and they can be stored, and this system is called PACS, picture, archiving, communications, and storage. 00:11:12[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:05:08And examination that serves no purpose is inappropriate, no matter how small the radiation dose. 00:05:15Ensuring that the results of earlier imaging are available helps avoid unnecessary exposure to radiation through repeat investigations. 00:05:23And so one of the things to note here, is the natural exposure to radiation, for example from the air or from traveling in an airplane. 00:05:34And compare that to the magnitude of radiation exposure and, for example, a single chest X-ray which is relatively small. 00:05:43And a chest CT scan, a  and where do you active materials to diagnose, treat and prevent disease? 00:03:18So radiology is generally the term interchangeable with diagnostic imaging or medical imaging right. 00:03:26So basically one can be substituted for the other without changing the meaning so these things are all essentially mean the same thing, right? 00:03:36Findings from the radiology report. 00:03:38Findings from diagnostic imaging, results of medical imaging, etc. 00:03:41They all sort of convey the same idea. 00:03:43[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:49So what is musculoskeletal imaging? 00:03:55That is an MSK right there. 00:03:59That's a subspecialty of radiology. 00:04:01Looking at the musculoskeletal system, so conventional radiography or X rays. 00:04:07That's usually the first order culoskeletal system, so conventional radiography or X rays. 00:04:07That's usually the first order imaging procedure after the clinical examination when we're looking for suspected musculoskeletal pathology. 00:04:16So if a patient is suspected of having a fracture, it's very likely that the x-ray will be the first choice for imaging. 00:04:25[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:29So in 1895, Willem Roentgen, that's this gentleman right here I was working in his dark laboratory in Germany. 00:04:37And he noticed that a screen that was painted with a fluorescent material and located a few feet away in the same room as a cathode ray tube started to glow. 00:04:50So this screen somewhere over here, if this room was dark, is now glowing and after repeating the experiment. 00:04:58He recognized that the screen was responding to the nearby , is now glowing and after repeating the experiment. 00:04:58He recognized that the screen was responding to the nearby production of a form of energy that was transmitted invisibly through the room from this cathode ray tube. 00:05:11So here's this cathode ray tube imaginary one over here. 00:05:15But it's transmitting this invisible energy over here to this screen. 00:05:21And he named those rays x-rays using the mathematical symbol x,because x symbolizes something unknown. 00:05:30And it didn't take very long before almost everyone was taking x rays of almost everything that they could think of. 00:05:36[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:39So x-rays were used to detect art forgeries and they were used in jewel

and customers at shoe stores could have X-rays taken to the feet inside a new pair of shoes. 00:05:57We can see here. 00:05:59So this is illustrating some x-ray proof clothing here on this lady, and by using the x-ray proof clothing. 00:06:09Apparently, someone wielding an x-ray wouldn't be able to look at your bones, which I guess was important. 00:06:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:21So in the early 1900s, there was an X-ray craze. 00:06:25The X-rays were seen as a miracle cure and they could do things like kill germs and improve beauty. 00:06:32But exposure to radiation had consequences. 00:06:37And by World War I, there was a very popular image of a radiologist  radiation had consequences. 00:06:37And by World War I, there was a very popular image of a radiologist, and that image included a gloved or an amputated hand, which was a result of that hand being exposed to x-rays, right? 00:06:52But even as those x-rays became combined to medical settings, they're is still used and coin operated Foot-o-Scopes which were used for looking at feet all the way up until after World War Two. 00:07:06And then in 1957 Pennsylvania became the first state to ban the use of those Foot-o-Scopes. 00:07:13[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:07:14We can see one of those over here Foot-o-Scope. 00:07:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:24So, in the 1910s and 20s, the military was using x-rays to screen for tuberculosis :07:24So, in the 1910s and 20s, the military was using x-rays to screen for tuberculosis via chest x-rays. 00:07:33The military was also using x-rays to examine bullet wounds and fractures. 00:07:39And military was very active during that time, driving trucks with portable x-ray units. 00:07:47And then we have the development of diagnostic ultrasound and that evolved from sonar technology. 00:07:55And in the 1920s and 30s nuclear medicine development continued and still there wasn't much consideration given to radiation exposure. 00:08:05And in fact, the average age of death around that time for a radiologist was about 56 years old, Marie curie's notebooks are still radioactive today. 00:08:16So in 1945, the detonation of atomic bombs generated more interest in the effects of exposure to radiation. 00:08:25And in the 50s and 60  atomic bombs generated more interest in the effects of exposure to radiation. 00:08:25And in the 50s and 60s, effective dose limits began to be talked about and what that meant was that there became this recognition that no dose exists below which the risk of damage does not exist. 00:08:40So, the idea was to keep the dose as low as reasonably achievable right here ALARA as low as reasonably achievable. 00:08:55So in the 1970s computer-heated tomography permitted cross-sectional images. 00:09:01And a single slice of image took around 4.5 minutes of scanning and then 1.5 minutes of processing, today, it takes less than a second. 00:09:13In 1984, MRI was approved for clinical use. 00:09:18Right here, in the 1990s, functional MRI changed the way we can view the chemical composition of the brain. 00:09:30And after that charged-  functional MRI changed the way we can view the chemical composition of the brain. 00:09:30And after that charged-coupled devices began to translate light to images, and we were able to convert film-based to digital imaging. 00:09:42And then picture archiving and communication systems, PACS, allowed the storage and the viewing and filing and transmission of images so that. 00:09:52A whole network of clinicians could have immediate access to an image. 00:09:57Computer-assisted diagnostics and pattern recognitions 00:10:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:04Began to pick up, and those are still being developed today. 00:10:07But humans are still better at identifying harmful non-normal kinds of images. 00:10:14But things like image-guided surgery continue to progress and surgical robotics, molecular imaging, PET-CT and PET MRI. 00:10:22PET stands  surgery continue to progress and surgical robotics, molecular imaging, PET-CT and PET MRI. 00:10:22PET stands for positron emission. 00:10:25In these kinds of developments enable more individualized approaches to different treatments. 00:10:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:34So medical images that were stored on film really have acquired an incredible amount of space for storage in a facility and in addition, a film could only be at one location at any time. 00:10:47And so this meant that there were times when a film might be needed to help determine the care for a patient, but that film may not be available at that location. 00:10:57So now studies are maintained on servers where images can be archive. 00:11:02They can be transmitted or communicated to others, and they can be stored, and this system is called PACS, picture, archiving, communications, and storage. 00:  they can be stored, and this system is called PACS, picture, archiving, communications, and storage. 00:11:12[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:05:08And examination that serves no purpose is inappropriate, no matter how small the radiation dose. 00:05:15Ensuring that the results of earlier imaging are available helps avoid unnecessary exposure to radiation through repeat investigations. 00:05:23And so one of the things to note here, is the natural exposure to radiation, for example from the air or from traveling in an airplane. 00:05:34And compare that to the magnitude of radiation exposure and, for example, a single chest X-ray which is relatively small. 00:05:43And a chest CT scan, a single scan which is orders of magnitude larger in terms of radiation exposure. 00:05:52[BL  example, a single chest X-ray which is relatively small. 00:05:43And a chest CT scan, a single scan which is orders of magnitude larger in terms of radiation exposure. 00:05:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:56So this term over here, ALARA, stands for As Low As Reasonably Achievable. 00:06:02And I included this slide to provide additional examples of radiation exposure. 00:06:08And so we can see the naturally occurring yearly exposure here is 3 milli sieverts and average US background radiation is 3.6. 00:06:18Again, we compare that to a chest CT here of 5 to 8, and compare that again to an abdominal CT 5 to 10 millisieverts. 00:06:28So a CT of the abdomen with a dose of 10 millisieverts is approximately equivalent to 500 chest X-rays, or three years of average US background  CT scan, a single scan which is orders of magnitude larger in terms of radiation exposure. 00:05:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:56So this term over here, ALARA, stands for As Low As Reasonably Achievable. 00:06:02And I included this slide to provide additional examples of radiation exposure. 00:06:08And so we can see the naturally occurring yearly exposure here is 3 milli sieverts and average US background radiation is 3.6. 00:06:18Again, we compare that to a chest CT here of 5 to 8, and compare that again to an abdominal CT 5 to 10 millisieverts. 00:06:28So a CT of the abdomen with a dose of 10 millisieverts is approximately equivalent to 500 chest X-rays, or three years of average US background radiation. 00:06:40[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what�  of average US background radiation. 00:06:40[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:03:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:31Thickness and orientation of an object will also affect the image. 00:03:37Radiographic density as a function of thickness of the object will vary. 00:03:45So pretend the objects being radiographed are a series of bone slices, each progressively thicker in a stepwise fashion. 00:03:52Now look at the developed image, it also has a stepwise increase in lighter shades Gray. 00:03:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:03The finished slice of bone on the left image is the least radio dense and the thickest slice on the far right is the most radio dense. 00:04:15The point here is that the thicker any est slice on the far right is the most radio dense. 00:04:15The point here is that the thicker any object is, the greater amount of radiation it will absorb compared to a thinner object or a thinner portion of the same object. 00:04:25[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:28Now, if we look at images A through F over here. 00:04:32[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:04:34This is a wedge of wood radiographed from three different angles and it produces three distinctly different radiographic shape outlines. 00:04:43With varying radiographic densities depending on how much thickness of wood the beam passes through 00:04:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:59This effect is seen also in the bottom right here with this tube. 00:05:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:12For a radiograph to be useful, more than 05:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:12For a radiograph to be useful, more than one projection is required. 00:05:17A single image only provides information in two dimensions, length and width. 00:05:22So that third dimension depth is achieved through a second radiograph performed at a 90 degree angle to the first one. 00:05:31Two images taken at right angles to each other provide information on length, width, and depth. 00:05:38And we can see that over here with this image of a finger 00:05:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:49This slide is also meant to discuss the importance of having multiple images. 00:05:54For A over here, the lateral projection of the cervical spine best demonstrates the facet joints indicated by the point of the pen. 00:06:05So you can find the facet joint on the corresponding lateral radiograph on C  point of the pen. 00:06:05So you can find the facet joint on the corresponding lateral radiograph on C right here. 00:06:12The facet joint space images as a dark diagonal line or arrow. 00:06:17Again, that dark diagonal line is dark because it's not as dense as the bone. 00:06:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:27In B, 00:06:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:31The oblique projection of the cervical spine best demonstrates the intervertebral foramina. 00:06:37The tip of the pen is at the C5-6 right intervertebral foramen, look at the corresponding radiograph in D. 00:06:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:47The intervertebral forum in images as a dark oval, and that's right here. 00:06:52Again The intervertebral forum in images as a dark oval, and that's right here. 00:06:52Again, it's dark because it's less dense than the surrounding tissue and bone. 00:06:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:02So we have a two radiograph minimum, when you want to use these radiographs to provide information about the dimension of the structure and so that requires to radiographs. 00:07:14This will also allow us to locate lesions or foreign bodies and determine alignment of fractures. 00:07:21So the most common projections for the skeleton are the AP, lateral and oblique projections. 00:07:27Oblique projections may be included during joint examinations or examinations where the surface topography is more complex. 00:07:36[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:39So this slide apparently needs a slide title, we'll call it The 4. 00:07:  00:07:39So this slide apparently needs a slide title, we'll call it The 4. 00:07:47[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:50Major radio densities. 00:07:54[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:58And those are depicted in this image and in number 1 over here. 00:08:05Air can be seen in the descending colon and also in the center of the pelvis, and this is the typical speckled look of feces mixed with gas right there. 00:08:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:18If we look at number 2, this is fat seen as this sort of dark streak either side there. 00:08:28And that's fatty layer next to the peritoneum and the abdominal wall and that stripe is the fold of the fat layer as it turns posteriorly towards the patient's back. 00:08:42Now in  is the fold of the fat layer as it turns posteriorly towards the patient's back. 00:08:42Now in number 3 over here, what we can see is water and muscles and soft tissue share the same density as water. 00:08:52And many water density organs, vessels, and muscles comprise the shades of gray in this radiograph. 00:09:00The arrow points to the so as muscle as it extends along the border of the lumbar spine. 00:09:08So right in here. 00:09:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:16And then number 4 is bone, and we can see the bony components of the proximal femur and the pelvis and sacrum and the spine. 00:09:27And this picture, we can really see how radio dense or bright bone is. 00:09:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:40So this slide depicts  bright bone is. 00:09:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:40So this slide depicts media and heavy metals in imaging. 00:09:46And if we look over here first on the left, The lower GI dual contrast medium examination is depicted here. 00:09:54And this normal colon is coated inside with barium and extended with air and so that's what the dual refers to, the barium and the air. 00:10:05The bright white outline caused by the medium allows detailed visualization of the structures, which wouldn't normally be visible on plain radiographs. 00:10:14And the image on the right here, this is a total hip replacement or a total hip arthroplasty. 00:10:22The metals used in the prosthetic of this joint, they absorb the x-rays and cast a solid white image on the radiograph, very radio dense. 00:10:32So any anatomic rays and cast a solid white image on the radiograph, very radio dense. 00:10:32So any anatomic structures behind the metal or the prosthesis are obscured. 00:10:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:42So in this slide we'll go over some terms for patient positioning and x-ray projection. 00:10:48So the position is how the patient is placed during the radiographic exam, and examples include supine, prone, sideline, recumbent, those are standard. 00:10:59We also have erect or weight bearing, and that indicates that the joints are under the effect of gravity, or under load. 00:11:06The projection is what direction the x-ray travels in in relation to the patient's body and so we have anterior posterior oblique and lateral 00:11:18[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:25So these are some examples of oblique views.  a dose of 10 millisieverts is approximately equivalent to 500 chest X-rays, or three years of average US background radiation. 00:06:40[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:03:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:31Thickness and orientation of an object will also affect the image. 00:03:37Radiographic density as a function of thickness of the object will vary. 00:03:45So pretend the objects being radiographed are a series of bone slices, each progressively thicker in a stepwise fashion. 00:03:52Now look at the developed image, it also has a stepwise increase in lighter shades Gray. 00:03:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:03The finished slice of bone on the left image is the least radio dense and the thickest slice on the 11:18[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:25So these are some examples of oblique views. 00:11:29And when these images are viewed, they can either be done in light boxes or digitally using a monitor. 00:11:36And the image is usually viewed with the image in the anatomical position. 00:11:41In other words, if you have an anterior posterior image of the knee, you want to have the image position so that it looks like the patient is standing in front of you. 00:11:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:55So in this slide we'll talk about some basic radiographic terminology again. 00:12:00So position identifies the patient's position in two ways, in reference to the general body position and in reference to specific positions describing which body part is closest to the image receptor. 00:12:16Decubitus, here the patient may be lying prone sup  part is closest to the image receptor. 00:12:16Decubitus, here the patient may be lying prone supine all on one side. 00:12:23Usually these positions are used to detect air fluid levels in the chest and abdomen. 00:12:28Radiographs can be made with the patient upright and [UNKNOWN] in standing position. 00:12:33And rectal wing bearing/u can establish that joints were gravity and or wing bearing/u independent. 00:12:40And usually if a joint is wing bearing, this is marked on the radiograph. 00:12:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:48And so in position starting with A, right, we have general positions including upright, seated, supine, prone, erect, recumbent and Trendelenburg. 00:13:00And then specific describing which body part is closest to the image receptor as I mentioned earlier, and then  00:13:00And then specific describing which body part is closest to the image receptor as I mentioned earlier, and then decubitus is basically our lying positions. 00:13:10For more on this you can see table 1.5 and figure 1.16 in your McKinnis text. 00:13:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:24So as I mentioned earlier, it's important to always view the radiographs as if viewing the patient and the anatomic position, right? 00:13:33So the radiographs are viewed as if the patient we're standing right in front of the viewer, in the anatomic position. 00:13:38This AP radiograph of the knee is being viewed properly. 00:13:42The R marker and we can see that right here, tells us this is the patient's right leg. 00:13:50So the radiograph is viewed with the fibula to the viewer's  the patient's right leg. 00:13:50So the radiograph is viewed with the fibula to the viewer's left hand side. 00:13:56The small letters below the R are the technician's initials. 00:14:02The pathology indicated in the circle is an osteogenic sarcoma. 00:14:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:17Image quality, density is the amount of blackening on an image, and contrast is the difference between the adjacent image densities. 00:14:29Detail refers to the geometric sharpness or the accuracy of the lines on the radiograph for example the resolution, the definition or the sharpness. 00:14:39Distortion refers to the difference between the actual object and the recorded images. 00:14:46So density and contrast are photographic properties that control visibility, detail and distortion are geometric properties that control clarity. 00:14:58[BLANK_AUDIO  that control visibility, detail and distortion are geometric properties that control clarity. 00:14:58[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:03:14Essentially, we would be able to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of care delivery. 00:03:19[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:25Over-utilization is a long-standing problem in referring for imaging. 00:03:30In this study of 2,051 lumbar spine MRIs ordered by general practitioners, 75% of those studies were deemed inappropriate. 00:03:40The majority of these referrals did not meet the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria for imaging a patient with low back pain. 00:03:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:52So what is ACR? 00:03:54American College of, not R AUDIO] 00:03:52So what is ACR? 00:03:54American College of, not Rheumatology, this is not correct, the American College of Radiology. 00:04:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:08American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria, ACR, AC for Appropriateness Criteria. 00:04:15So this information helps with assisting in making the most appropriate imaging or treatment decision. 00:04:25In the US, the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria is considered the gold standard decision making guideline. 00:04:34Which imaging modality is recommended for a suspected diagnosis, for example, you would turn to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria. 00:04:43The goal of the ACR Appropriateness Criteria is to assist referring physicians and other providers in making the most appropriate imaging or treatment decision for a specific clinical condition eness Criteria is to assist referring physicians and other providers in making the most appropriate imaging or treatment decision for a specific clinical condition. 00:04:57In addition, the ACR is intended to allow providers enhanced quality of care and to contribute to the efficacious use of radiology. 00:05:09So the American College of Rheumatology Appropriateness Criteria is an incredibly useful and important component of decision making in imaging. 00:05:19[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:25Factors for decision making according to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria include age, the presence or absence of trauma and mechanism of injury, prior surgery, pain provocation. 00:05:39And then there are also individual risk factors, such as physical appearance, neurologic status, other imaging results, weight-bearing ability and tenderness to palpation. 00:05:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:53So for example ness to palpation. 00:05:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:53So for example, how old is the patient? 00:05:56Under age, an 85-year-old patient with shoulder pain that has been worsening over time suggests differential diagnoses that are different from a 14-year-old with similar symptoms and progression of pain and loss of function. 00:06:11In terms of trauma, presence or absence, when the patient presents, was the injury a result of trauma? 00:06:17Was the mechanism of injury one that might suggest underlying pathology? 00:06:21For example, the patient was reaching for a bag and felt a pop versus the patient reports waking up with shoulder discomfort. 00:06:30Is there a history of prior surgery? 00:06:32If this patient with shoulder pain has a recent history of full thickness rotator cuff repair, then your differential diagnosis might include a failure of that  with shoulder pain has a recent history of full thickness rotator cuff repair, then your differential diagnosis might include a failure of that repair. 00:06:42And finally, physical examination and functional test results. 00:06:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:52So we can imagine a patient presents to you in the clinic with right shoulder pain. 00:06:57And the pain began a couple of weeks ago, and they cannot recall a specific inciting event. 00:07:02Basically, they don't remember doing anything to cause their shoulder to hurt. 00:07:06And so that's what we're looking at here, is a clinical condition, shoulder pain, a traumatic. 00:07:14So an example of applying the ACR appropriateness scale to a patient who presents with shoulder pain that was not the result of trauma. 00:07:22In this table, if your patient's shoulder disorder was severe enough that it  the result of trauma. 00:07:22In this table, if your patient's shoulder disorder was severe enough that it limited their function and after a history and physical examination, you might then refer them for x-ray if you suspect a fracture. 00:07:35If, however, you suspect that bony integrity is maintained, right, that you don't suspect a fracture, and instead that the diagnosis is likely a disruption of the soft tissue of the rotator cuff. 00:07:47For example, your patient cannot lift their extremity or strength testing reveals marked deficits that cannot be explained by guarding, that is, instead of an x-ray, an MRI would be the most appropriate imaging modality. 00:08:00In this case, at least in Arizona, you would need to refer the patient to their referring provider, along with the suggestion to consider MRI to rule out a meaningful rotator cuff disorder. 00:08:12[BLANK_AUD :04:03The finished slice of bone on the left image is the least radio dense and the thickest slice on the far right is the most radio dense. 00:04:15The point here is that the thicker any object is, the greater amount of radiation it will absorb compared to a thinner object or a thinner portion of the same object. 00:04:25[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:28Now, if we look at images A through F over here. 00:04:32[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:04:34This is a wedge of wood radiographed from three different angles and it produces three distinctly different radiographic shape outlines. 00:04:43With varying radiographic densities depending on how much thickness of wood the beam passes through 00:04:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:59This effect is seen also in the bottom right here with this tube. 00:05:04[  the suggestion to consider MRI to rule out a meaningful rotator cuff disorder. 00:08:12[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:16I included this slide here because one of the themes that will recur consistently throughout this course is that you must decide whether to treat the patient, to refer the patient out immediately, or to treat the patient and refer them out. 00:08:33[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:35So, if you decide to treat, you're deciding that the patient's condition is within the scope of PT practice. 00:08:42If you're deciding to refer the patient, you've decided that the patient's condition warrants referral to another provider. 00:08:50If you're deciding to treat and refer, this means management of a portion of this patient's presentation is within the scope of PT practice. 00:08:58However, the patient may need or benefit from the services of another provider.  scope of PT practice. 00:08:58However, the patient may need or benefit from the services of another provider. 00:09:04And it may be for the same condition or a condition that's occurring along with this one but is different. 00:09:12[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:17When you're considering referring a patient for imaging, one of the things to keep in mind is the financial implications. 00:09:25And looking at this table, we can see that, first of all, conventional radiographs, we can imagine around $450. 00:09:34A CT scan, $2,000, MRI, $3,500, bone scan, $1,400. 00:09:41In addition to the financial obligations, there's also the average radiation dose. 00:09:48And so, here we can see an x-ray is about 1.5, and we've gone over this :48And so, here we can see an x-ray is about 1.5, and we've gone over this before. 00:09:54A bone scan of the whole skeleton here is 6.3 millisieverts. 00:10:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:05In addition, as you're considering whether or not to refer a patient for imaging, remember that you should rarely perform imaging as an exploratory tool. 00:10:15You should have an idea of what the imaging will show, and you should anticipate a course of action based on predicted imaging results. 00:10:24So what this means is that you should have formed a hypothesis regarding what you think is going on first. 00:10:29And you should have some idea of what you'll do if your hypothesis proves to be correct. 00:10:34And also, what you'll do if your hypothesis is not correct. 00:10:  correct. 00:10:34And also, what you'll do if your hypothesis is not correct. 00:10:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:43So as you consider whether or not to refer your patient for imaging, you should reflect on whether the imaging will contribute to a change in your diagnosis or treatment. 00:10:54And a thorough patient examination will help you make appropriate imaging decisions. 00:10:58The history and physical examination are necessary to assist in deciding whether imaging is needed and what type of imaging would be most useful. 00:11:07Prudent use of imaging is informed by a really sound patient examination. 00:11:13If imaging confirms what is anticipated based on all prior information collected by you and the course of care is routinely managed by physical therapists, then imaging results will not contribute much to your initial plan of care. 00:11:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:34  much to your initial plan of care. 00:11:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:34Consider a scenario where a patient is not progressing as expected or their condition is worsening, or consider a case where you're concerned about some serious underlying pathology. 00:11:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:47A patient with anterior hip inguinal and medial thigh pain, which is aggravated by walking, presents to you in the clinic. 00:11:55This patient also has a 20-year history of taking corticosteroids, and because of this, the patient's risk for osteonecrosis of the femoral head is elevated. 00:12:07After thoroughly considering the patient's history and physical examination findings, imaging may be warranted prior to proceeding with physical therapy treatment. 00:12:16If the patient did not have a long history of continuous corticosteroid use, then imaging may not be warranted. 16If the patient did not have a long history of continuous corticosteroid use, then imaging may not be warranted. 00:12:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:26And so what we're looking at here is a avascular necrosis of the femoral head. 00:12:30[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:03:07And so looking at the radiographs, you can become a little more aware of how the joints of the hand, wrist, and forearm, or maybe the elbow have the potential to be affected by the deformity, right? 00:03:20So you can imagine a bony deformity heals in a way that, for example, in the elbow could limit terminal extension. 00:03:28And so you could be trying to stretch a person into terminal extension when that range is limited by a  00:03:28And so you could be trying to stretch a person into terminal extension when that range is limited by a bony block that's obviously not going to stretch. 00:03:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:43So referring the patient for imaging, communication with the radiologist or the imaging service before and after the imaging procedure is critical in achieving optimal patient care with continuity. 00:03:59So that means the idea isn't simply to refer your patient out for imaging and then see what happens. 00:04:06It's really going to be incumbent upon you as therapists to make sure that you follow up with the imaging specialist. 00:04:14And so in the APTA standards of practice for physical therapy, it states that a physical therapy service collaborates with all disciplines as appropriate. 00:04:24And the physical therapist must refer patients, clients, to the referring practitioner or other health care practitioners if symptoms are present :24And the physical therapist must refer patients, clients, to the referring practitioner or other health care practitioners if symptoms are present for which physical therapy is contraindicated or are indicative of conditions for which treatment is outside the scope of his or her knowledge. 00:04:42So, really, it's on you to recognize when you might be dealing with something that you're unfamiliar with in a way that you believe warrants additional information outside the scope of physical therapy practice. 00:04:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:04So, when you request imaging in a referral, your request should include relevant clinical information, a working diagnosis, pertinent clinical signs and symptoms, and also a specific question to be answered. 00:05:25And the American College of Radiology encourages that the request for imaging, quote, should provide sufficient information to demonstrate the medical necessity of the examination, and allow for its proper performance and interpretation unquote. 00:05:42  to demonstrate the medical necessity of the examination, and allow for its proper performance and interpretation unquote. 00:05:42And so that means two things, really. 00:05:44One is that you really should only refer those patients who you believe are going to have a high likelihood of benefiting in terms of their outcomes from that imaging. 00:06:02And you should include information that's going to allow the radiologist to use the appropriate imaging modality and the appropriate views to get information that's going to be meaningful for the patient. 00:06:18So, the American College of Rheumatology also states that the referral for imaging should include relevant clinical information on working diagnosis and or pertinent clinical signs and symptoms. 00:06:33And of particular relevance to the importance of a thorough history and physical examination, the referral should contain a specific question to be answered. 00:06:45And complete communication with the imaging referral really helps tailor, like I said  specific question to be answered. 00:06:45And complete communication with the imaging referral really helps tailor, like I said before, the most appropriate imaging study for that patient and enhances the usefulness of the imaging report. 00:07:01So rather than simply requesting an x-ray of a patient's elbow, providing information such as suspicion of radial head fracture based on whatever the patient's medical history is, and based on your physical test and measures results, which you would also include in the report. 00:07:20That information can assist in the selection process of the imaging modality and the radiographic views. 00:07:29And so, the imaging is really going to be enhanced with the radiologist being better informed by you of the suspected specific anatomy that you'd like them to look at. 00:07:43So improving the availability of the clinical history and other relevant patient information has been cited in a number of different studies as a measure for improving the diagnostic process  00:04:59This effect is seen also in the bottom right here with this tube. 00:05:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:12For a radiograph to be useful, more than one projection is required. 00:05:17A single image only provides information in two dimensions, length and width. 00:05:22So that third dimension depth is achieved through a second radiograph performed at a 90 degree angle to the first one. 00:05:31Two images taken at right angles to each other provide information on length, width, and depth. 00:05:38And we can see that over here with this image of a finger 00:05:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:49This slide is also meant to discuss the importance of having multiple images. 00:05:54For A over here, the lateral projection of the cervical spine best demonstrates the facet joints indicated by the point of the pen  the clinical history and other relevant patient information has been cited in a number of different studies as a measure for improving the diagnostic process. 00:07:55And you can also provide your patients with an explanation of tests that you're ordering and why you're ordering them. 00:08:02And you can explain to them the purpose of the test and maybe what you expect to find, and how your treatment plan may change, or their expectations may change, based on the imaging results. 00:08:15Also make sure when you do describe your concerns in a letter to your referral source, that you describe them in a succinct approach. 00:08:29And that you explain that the symptoms aren't consistent with what you would expect. 00:08:33Or that those symptoms may be inconsistent with some group of words that might be useful, like inconsistent with musculoskeletal pathology, or inconsistent with neuromusculoskeletal pathology, etc. 00:08:  musculoskeletal pathology, or inconsistent with neuromusculoskeletal pathology, etc. 00:08:50But something to sort of hint that additional medical specialization may be needed in order to uncover whatever is actually going on. 00:09:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:07What about the negative consequences of imaging? 00:09:10These are things that you also need to weigh as you decide whether or not to refer that patient back for additional medical evaluation. 00:09:20One is the idea of medicalization. 00:09:23And this means a negative impact on the patient's psychosocial status, possible negative impact on outcomes related to their medical condition as a result of additional medical studies. 00:09:38So we know that low back pain imaging research consistently shows a delay in return to work and lower functional outcomes versus no imaging for the same patients. 00:09:51Second, exposure to ionizing  to work and lower functional outcomes versus no imaging for the same patients. 00:09:51Second, exposure to ionizing radiation. 00:09:54So you have to monitor over time the cumulative doses or dosage of ionizing radiation, because that effect is cumulative. 00:10:05And finally, a negative consequence of imaging is the potential costs. 00:10:12So, back in the day, for me, it's oh, 2005, 2006, I worked with a group of surgeons, and we had an MRI machine in the office. 00:10:24And at that time, an MRI typically cost around $1,500 to $1,700. 00:10:31And so you can imagine co-pays, or even those cases where a patient may not have insurance to cover the cost of imaging, that's a really important factor to consider as you decide whether or not to refer that patient. 00:10:48It's not the  really important factor to consider as you decide whether or not to refer that patient. 00:10:48It's not the most important factor, right? 00:10:51Obviously the most important factor is going to be the patient's health and long-term, functional outcome, and ability to return to their usual kinds of life activities. 00:11:04But cost is something that really needs to be considered. 00:11:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:12Interpretation and communication of the imaging results. 00:11:17So your patient has come back and they have their imaging, and the imaging is in their electronic medical record and you can see those images. 00:11:29So the question becomes, do you then look at the images and provide a diagnosis to that patient, right? 00:11:37So the patient hasn't received the diagnosis from the radiologist yet. 00:11:42And so, medically :37So the patient hasn't received the diagnosis from the radiologist yet. 00:11:42And so, medically and legally, the interpretation of the images is the purview of the radiologist. 00:11:49But PTs, by virtue of their education, training and experience should be able to recognize and understand normal anatomy, including the anatomy associated with usual lifespan changes, or anatomic variance, and then contrast that to abnormal anatomy. 00:12:08But the comprehensive interpretation and description of that anatomy is outside of the current scope of PT practice. 00:12:19Which essentially means that it's probably not a great idea if you have those imaging findings and you don't have a radiologist interpretation along with those findings, all you have is the imaging, to use that imaging to provide a diagnosis to that patient. 00:12:36That is outside of your scope of practice, medically and legally. 00:12:42That you really need to wait 36That is outside of your scope of practice, medically and legally. 00:12:42That you really need to wait for the radiologist to interpret the imaging study. 00:12:50So you have to recognize and maintain the practice boundaries regarding interpreting medical imaging. 00:12:57And so, once you have that interpretation from the radiologist, this allows for educating the patient regarding their imaging results. 00:13:05Including what those results mean and the context of each patient's age, gender, and lifestyle, and symptoms, etc. 00:13:13And the physical therapists can also provide reassurance, such as helpful contextual information to the patient to improve the understanding of their imaging results. 00:13:24And that leads to a better informed patient without the potentially negative influences associated with the imaging results, right, or medicalization. 00:13:33And so that's where it's really important for you to be able to look at an image . 00:13:33And so that's where it's really important for you to be able to look at an image and at least have some idea of what's going on in that image, right? 00:13:42In this case, you're not providing a diagnosis, but by going over what you see in the image and incorporating that with the radiologist's interpretation of the image, the patient can then become better informed and more comfortable with what's being seen in that image or the information contained in that image. 00:14:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:09So routine radiographic examination results can be positive for the suspected diagnosis, negative for the suspected diagnosis. 00:14:19Negative for one diagnosis, but raising suspicion for another diagnosis. 00:14:24Or they could be inconclusive and you could require additional imaging to confirm or rule out the suspected diagnosis. 00:14:33And that could actually be mentioned by  could require additional imaging to confirm or rule out the suspected diagnosis. 00:14:33And that could actually be mentioned by the radiologist in their follow up. 00:14:38And another possible alternative here is that your initial suspicion was wrong. 00:14:45So, in this case, the images are negative for the pathologic changes that you suspected, but the patient still does not improve with physical therapy. 00:14:54And so the imaging is performed again one month later, demonstrating a stress fracture, for example, at the talar neck, and the patient is referred for surgery. 00:15:04So what I'm kind of getting it, there is that you may have a patient who has some pathology that is present. 00:15:14But it's present in a way that's not been picked up by the imaging, and over time the size or the intensity of that pathology grows. 00:15:27So, in this example, , and over time the size or the intensity of that pathology grows. 00:15:27So, in this example, the fracture size grows and a month later it's large enough that it actually does show up on the imaging. 00:15:38So, you could imagine a patient comes to see you at the clinic and they say that they stepped on the fold of a towel getting out of the shower, resulting in severe pain along the bottom and outside of their foot. 00:15:49And then after completing this patient's history and physical examination, you're worried that maybe they sustained a fracture to their fifth metatarsal. 00:16:00So after talking about this with your patient, you refer the patient for a radiographic examination to rule out that fracture the fifth metatarsal. 00:16:09So, once the patient receives radiographic examination and the results are interpreted by a radiologist, those results are going to include one of the following things that  radiographic examination and the results are interpreted by a radiologist, those results are going to include one of the following things that we mentioned before, right? 00:16:19Positive for the suspected diagnosis, negative for one diagnosis, but now there's a suspicion of something else, inconclusive. 00:16:28And then potentially wrong initial suspicion. 00:16:31[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:16:36So when you're speaking with your patient about your imaging results, explain to your patient the results that are relevant to them. 00:16:44You don't need to explain everything you know about imaging and attempt to impress them. 00:16:50And in this slide, I have a little tiny quote that says, you shouldn't tell an audience everything you know. 00:16:57That was an effort to impress them. 00:17:00Instead, you should tell them what they need to know. 00:17: 54For A over here, the lateral projection of the cervical spine best demonstrates the facet joints indicated by the point of the pen. 00:06:05So you can find the facet joint on the corresponding lateral radiograph on C right here. 00:06:12The facet joint space images as a dark diagonal line or arrow. 00:06:17Again, that dark diagonal line is dark because it's not as dense as the bone. 00:06:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:27In B, 00:06:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:31The oblique projection of the cervical spine best demonstrates the intervertebral foramina. 00:06:37The tip of the pen is at the C5-6 right intervertebral foramen, look at the corresponding radiograph in D. 00:06:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:47The interverte  to impress them. 00:17:00Instead, you should tell them what they need to know. 00:17:03And that's an effort to teach them. 00:17:05And so your goal is to take something that's potentially scary or intimidating and translate it in a way for that patient that allows them to understand the information. 00:17:19And if you do it really well, it allows the patient to become more comfortable with the material contained in that imaging. 00:17:28And more willing to sort of move forward with whatever treatment you decide it's going to be appropriate. 00:17:35So the PT should know when to order diagnostic imaging and how to communicate effectively with the radiologist. 00:17:44And the PT may not have the primary responsibility to interpret the images, but you should be able to identify and manage clinically relevant findings. 00:17:55And to be effective, you have to establish lines of communication with  identify and manage clinically relevant findings. 00:17:55And to be effective, you have to establish lines of communication with the radiologist, with the patient, front office staff, and you have to build relationships with radiologists and other specialists. 00:18:07So the communication between the physical therapist and the radiologist may be required to determine the next steps after imaging. 00:18:15So, think about scheduling a follow-up visit for your patient as soon as possible after the results of an imaging study are available, or communicate those results by telephone. 00:18:28[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:03:23So this is an X-ray. 00:03:26And so we can see the contrast material here in A. 00:03:30I could see it here and be here, down here, but there's a space  in A. 00:03:30I could see it here and be here, down here, but there's a space here. 00:03:39And so from the radiograph, we can see that something's going on. 00:03:42There's a space, and it's not continuous that flow of contrast material, right? 00:03:47It doesn't flow continuously from here, all the way down, something's interrupting that flow. 00:03:53Now we compare these with our CT myelogram down here right again, this is X-ray radiography and this is a CT. 00:04:01So we compare this with our with our CT myelogram and C is a coronal reformatted image and D is a sagittal reformat. 00:04:11And there's normal contrast filling the fecal space at all areas except at L1. 00:04:20And so when we look up here at  the fecal space at all areas except at L1. 00:04:20And so when we look up here at L1, there's a bony defect that impinges on the fecal sac and indents the column of contrast. 00:04:31And so that, if we look at image D right here that's occurring right here. 00:04:38So we can see this is really bright area because see how it's coming into the fecal sac, boy I really messed that up there we go. 00:04:46So you can see that now hopefully. 00:04:51And we can also look at C, and we can see here that we have contrast coming down here. 00:04:58And then there's a broken area. 00:05:00Okay, so the CT gives us a little more information than just the radiography. 00:05:10And so the other thing that I think is important here is  more information than just the radiography. 00:05:10And so the other thing that I think is important here is that you can actually see the conus medullaris of the spinal cord and the star right here. 00:05:19[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:22And then, down here you can actually see the Cotter going down there. 00:05:30So the advantage of the CT is the direct visualization of the soft tissues, and you can actually see the cause of the impingement, right? 00:05:38We can actually see this area right here. 00:05:45And if we look up here, all we can see is that, there's something going on so with with the Radiography essentially the take home I think here is with the radio radiography. 00:05:56We get sort of a general idea that yes, something's wrong. 00:06:00And with the 05:56We get sort of a general idea that yes, something's wrong. 00:06:00And with the CT, we can actually see okay, there's something going wrong and it looks like it's occurring here at L one. 00:06:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:12So, another common musculoskeletal imaging study is tomography and conventional tomography or body section radiography. 00:06:21Conventional tomography is the radiographic evaluation of one plane of the body. 00:06:27And the depth can be modified by adjusting the equipment a little bit. 00:06:33And the principle of dimensional tomography is that you have an X-ray tube and the film moves in an opposite direction from the X-ray tube. 00:06:43Right, so, here we have our X-ray tube up here. 00:06:46Here we have our film down here and , here we have our X-ray tube up here. 00:06:46Here we have our film down here and they move in opposite directions. 00:06:54The focal point, which is right here, that open circle remains in sharp focus while the other planes of the body, the dark circles become blurred by the motion. 00:07:07So imaging different depths of bone can allow a better understanding of the extent of a fracture, give you a little more information about it. 00:07:15And the evaluation of bony tumors can also be aided by conventional tomography. 00:07:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:27So, as opposed to conventional tomography, this is computed tomography, and what it does is it merges images from X-rays using a computer. 00:07:36Which reconstructs an axial cross-sectional slice of an image. 00:07:41And then processing can also 36Which reconstructs an axial cross-sectional slice of an image. 00:07:41And then processing can also reconstruct the data obtained in one plane and resolve it into multiple other planes. 00:07:47So, for example, data obtained in the axial plane can be resolved into sagittal, coronal, and even three-dimensional images like we see here. 00:07:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:01And so, this oblique view of the wrist demonstrates a fracture through the waist of the scaphoid bone that's been complicated by avascular necrosis of the proximal fragment. 00:08:13So, we see here an S right here, this fracture, 00:08:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:20And one there. 00:08:22And then the avascular necrosis down here. 00:08:25[BLANK_AUDIO] 00: 22And then the avascular necrosis down here. 00:08:25[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:30And so tumors of bone and soft tissue, fractures, joint abnormalities, bone fragments, and metabolic bone disorders can all benefit from the use of Computed Tomography 00:08:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:51So nuclear imaging, nuclear imaging uses radiopharmaceuticals or radioactive tracers to diagnose based on the physiological or the functional changes of the tissue or organ. 00:09:05And so, the pharma side targets a particular organ while the radionuclide emits gamma rays. 00:09:12And the tracers are absorbed by the target organ in varying amounts based on the level of metabolic activity in the tissue. 00:09:21So, in this image here, a 16-year-old girl is diagnosed with lymphoma and sent for PET/CT scan before starting chemotherapy. 00 , a 16-year-old girl is diagnosed with lymphoma and sent for PET/CT scan before starting chemotherapy. 00:09:33And you can see how the metabolic data from the PET scan and the anatomic data from the CT scan are combined. 00:09:41So, here's the PET scan right here, and here's the CT scan and we combine the two. 00:09:49To get this the pet CT scan and the tumor uses the tracer as fuel, and so it ends up lighting up with increased uptake. 00:10:01And that seen in the right upper region of the chest. 00:10:04[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:10:07And, apparently, after six months of chemotherapy, a repeat scan showed a significant reduction of the tumor, indicating that the treatment was successful. 00:10:18But I think the important takeaway here is understanding that you're taking the image qualities of the PET scan ograph in D. 00:06:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:47The intervertebral forum in images as a dark oval, and that's right here. 00:06:52Again, it's dark because it's less dense than the surrounding tissue and bone. 00:06:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:02So we have a two radiograph minimum, when you want to use these radiographs to provide information about the dimension of the structure and so that requires to radiographs. 00:07:14This will also allow us to locate lesions or foreign bodies and determine alignment of fractures. 00:07:21So the most common projections for the skeleton are the AP, lateral and oblique projections. 00:07:27Oblique projections may be included during joint examinations or examinations where the surface topography is more complex. 00:07:36[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:  00:10:18But I think the important takeaway here is understanding that you're taking the image qualities of the PET scan here, combining them with the CT scan, to produce this image here. 00:10:32So this is extremely useful in detecting tumors or tumor progression or regression. 00:10:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:46So radionuclide Imaging studies, radionuclide bone scan or bone scan or bone scintigraphy, really increased uptake of tracers generally occur under abnormal conditions where there's high metabolic activity. 00:11:03And this is visualized as black areas or hot spots on an image. 00:11:09And so bone scans highlight areas of hyperfunction or increased mineral turnover. 00:11:16So if we look at image A here, bone scans of three different patients, each with three different diagnoses, degenerative arthritis and metastatic cancer and acute trauma. 00:11:29  different patients, each with three different diagnoses, degenerative arthritis and metastatic cancer and acute trauma. 00:11:29The point is that all the scans look alike because they only measure hypermetabolism. 00:11:35Thus, bone scans are not independent studies, but they have to be corelated with clinical data to be meaningful. 00:11:42And so image A, the patient has a degenerative joint disease in multiple sites. 00:11:47And so we can see, the arrows indicating increased uptake in the cervical spine. 00:11:55Here, see how it's black, and the wrist here, it's black, and in the ankles. 00:12:03You can also see in the knee here. 00:12:07And that actually is a prosthesis at the knee joint, so a total knee replacement. 00:12:14And then if we look at E right there, that patient suffered a bruise to  knee replacement. 00:12:14And then if we look at E right there, that patient suffered a bruise to their glute medius muscle during football game. 00:12:23And increase uptake was an early indication of myositis ossificans developing in the muscle, so these two things here. 00:12:32So this person either landed on that side or someone hit them here, and now we have this development of bone that's turning over at a much increased rate versus everywhere else in the pelvis. 00:12:49Then if we look at C here, this patient has known lung cancer and the bone scan is done to identify the distribution of metastatic lesions in the skeleton. 00:13:00And increased uptake at the right scapula and the right shoulder shows areas of metastatic bone cancer so that's here and so that's the scapula. 00:13:12What? 00:13:13Over the top  here and so that's the scapula. 00:13:12What? 00:13:13Over the top of that thing. 00:13:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:19So anyway, here and here. 00:13:24And so, we can see this is the right shoulder here's the humerus coming down here, and here's the torso there. 00:13:31[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:36So, the limitation here is just this lack of specificity, right? 00:13:39All we can see is that there's bone turnover. 00:13:41We're not able to distinguish what process is causing the increased uptake of bone or the increased bone turnover. 00:13:48So, you have to have other clinical evaluations. 00:13:51Correlated with your bone scan in order to make a diagnosis for radionuclide bone scan or bone :13:51Correlated with your bone scan in order to make a diagnosis for radionuclide bone scan or bone scintigraphy. 00:13:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:06So magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, no ionizing radiation is produced by the MRI, and the inflammation is instead produced by the interaction of the tissue with a magnetic field. 00:14:22MRI is primarily used in the evaluation of soft tissue trauma and joint derangement and tumors. 00:14:29And so this image here is an MRI of the cervical spine. 00:14:35And in a here you can see the pons and B, you can see the spinal cord and C you can see the marrow of the C two vertebral body and D you can Visualize the, the intervertebral disc,C4, and five, right? 00:14:56So here's four, here's five, here's ,C4, and five, right? 00:14:56So here's four, here's five, here's the disc. 00:15:00Right? 00:15:01Here's three. 00:15:02[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:15:16So ultrasonography or musculoskeletal ultrasound. 00:15:21These images are generated using reflected sound waves. 00:15:25Like an MRI, there's no exposure to ionizing radiation, and it's non-invasive imaging. 00:15:34Different tissues absorb and reflect the sound waves uniquely. 00:15:39Diagnostic ultrasound is useful for lesions to muscles and tendons, ligaments, detection of cysts and soft tissue tumors. 00:15:48And for the measurement of blood flow. 00:15:52One meaningful advantage of ultrasound is that the images can be made during the physical examination of tissues, such as during 15:52One meaningful advantage of ultrasound is that the images can be made during the physical examination of tissues, such as during muscle contractions or passive stretching, or even while performing special tests. 00:16:05So it's a very functional kind of imaging runs there the patient remaining static like they would be for an MRI or an X-ray. 00:16:15The patient can actually be moving and you can visualize the structures as they move through space. 00:16:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:16:31The functional view of imaging starts with the patient and the evaluation, including the history and the physical. 00:16:38As opposed, you decide that something doesn't seem quite right, so you refer the patient out for imaging, and the patient undergoes imaging, the report's generated, the radiologist makes the diagnosis. 00:16:51And then proceed with treatment either a physical therapy or physical therapy is not appropriate with some  the diagnosis. 00:16:51And then proceed with treatment either a physical therapy or physical therapy is not appropriate with some other kinds of treatments. 00:16:59Essentially, diagnostic imaging is a link in a larger chain that starts and ends with the patient. 00:17:06So you have a picture or an image, but humans play a critical role in the imaging system. 00:17:12Through their interpretation of the image and by their correlation of the clinical findings with the information from that imaging. 00:17:19So the clinicians responsibility really is to recognize that if the results of imaging that imaging study don't fit the physical findings, then further clinical evaluation and diagnostic investigation are warranted. 00:17:35[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:02:51Number 5 is the belief that every possible step is being taken to obtain a diagnosis, and .com00:02:51Number 5 is the belief that every possible step is being taken to obtain a diagnosis, and so the clinician's need for action and certainty, right? 00:03:01A PT may need to feel secure that they have taken every possible step to solve the puzzle of obtaining a diagnosis. 00:03:09So to resolve uncertainty, does bringing the radiologist into the decision making process really add value, does it cause harm? 00:03:17In other words, occasionally during this process, a clinician may feel that more is always considered better, but it may be useful to consider, for example, how much better and at what cost? 00:03:32So be careful of using radiologic examination as a form of psychotherapy that gives some kind of degree of assurance or reassurance that may or may not be justified. 00:03:44Taking an action, such as ordering imaging, whether or not it improves the ability to  be justified. 00:03:44Taking an action, such as ordering imaging, whether or not it improves the ability to treat the underlying condition, really offers little benefit to the patient. 00:03:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:01So continuing with unnecessary examinations, why is there overutilization of x-rays? 00:04:09Well, part of it is patient demand. 00:04:11The patient may request an x-ray, whether or not it's relevant. 00:04:14For example, demanding an x-ray of an ankle, following a sprain, despite evidence from a set of rules indicating that imaging is probably not going to be incredibly useful. 00:04:25Reimbursement policies, when imaging is covered, you may be less concerned about the economic burden on patients. 00:04:32But as costs rise, or patients are required to fund, the likelihood of you ordering imaging may . 00:07:49[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:04:28Medications affecting bone density are also important screening components. 00:04:33Leg calf perthes is most common in 5-8 year old boys and they often report groin, thigh and knee pain that worsens with weight bearing activities. 00:04:43Slip capital femoral epiphysis occurs in adolescents and 2-1 in boys vs girls. 00:04:51Symptoms include groin, thigh or knee pain and limited hip internal rotation range of motion. 00:04:58Pathologic fractures of the femoral neck occur secondary to disease and often in the absence of major trauma. 00:05:05These fractures are most common in individuals over 50 years, women more often than men, and patients who have a history of metabolic bone disease, such as osteoporosis or  where the surface topography is more complex. 00:07:36[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:39So this slide apparently needs a slide title, we'll call it The 4. 00:07:47[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:50Major radio densities. 00:07:54[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:58And those are depicted in this image and in number 1 over here. 00:08:05Air can be seen in the descending colon and also in the center of the pelvis, and this is the typical speckled look of feces mixed with gas right there. 00:08:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:18If we look at number 2, this is fat seen as this sort of dark streak either side there. 00:08:28And that's fatty layer next to the peritoneum and the abdominal wall and that stripe is the fold of . 00:04:32But as costs rise, or patients are required to fund, the likelihood of you ordering imaging may decline. 00:04:42Number 3, defensive medicine, so this really concerns the idea of malpractice. 00:04:51So back in the 1970s, research already suggested around 30% of x-rays were performed defensively by clinicians who may have been concerned about taking every possible step to guarantee that nothing has been missed. 00:05:06Regardless of the cost or the potential harm in terms of financial, or radiation, or the things that we've discussed previously. 00:05:15So there's a belief that if a finding is not documented, that the provider could be sued. 00:05:21And experts in the field suggest that these types of examinations are not valid, and that future litigation may instead result from unnecessary radiation exposure, because of needless examinations rather than from too few examinations. 00:05:35Finally, economic incentive  from unnecessary radiation exposure, because of needless examinations rather than from too few examinations. 00:05:35Finally, economic incentive, so physician-owned imaging units, staff in these offices ordering their own imaging, interpreting them, and rendering charges. 00:05:45There's an incentive to perform more rather than fewer imaging studies. 00:05:51Even 40 years ago, non-radiologist physicians who owned their own extra equipment used an average of twice as many x-ray examinations as their colleagues who referred out to radiologists. 00:06:04So in summary, unnecessary radiological examinations can result in excess costs, excess radiation, wasting a patient's time, wasting a clinician's time, false hope and expectations, increased worry over findings which are not clinically meaningful. 00:06:21And they indicate a breakdown in the logical thought pattern concerning the patient's workup. 00:06:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:35So examples  the patient's workup. 00:06:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:35So examples of unnecessary examinations then, and these are all taken from a radiology textbook for radiology residents. 00:06:45So taking imaging of a nasal bone to rule out a broken nose. 00:06:49And this is unnecessary because if there's a fracture of a nasal bone, it won't be casted and it will not be reduced, and no treatment will be given regardless of what the x-ray shows. 00:07:01Even if the nasal bone is displaced badly enough to warrant an intervention, a CT facial series to be useful only to search for additional fractures. 00:07:11How about rib imaging? 00:07:13Well, fractured ribs are not uncommon, however, finding a rib fracture after trauma has almost no clinical significance and really does not alter treatment. 00:07:23A pneumothorax or even  trauma has almost no clinical significance and really does not alter treatment. 00:07:23A pneumothorax or even a lung contusion may be ruled out by chest films, but a rib series isn't necessary. 00:07:30A rib x-ray on a patient with rib pain to find a fracture that really serves little purpose other than to find a cause for the pain, and eliminating this series of rib imaging really will not change the course of the patient's treatment. 00:07:45Coccyx imaging to rule out a fracture isn't necessary because a fracture of the coccyx will not be casted or reduced, just like the nasal bone. 00:07:54So in addition, a meaningfully higher dose of gonadal radiation results from a coccyx x-ray. 00:08:01So because no change in treatment will occur, regardless of imaging results, coccyx imaging is likely not necessary. 00:08:09  change in treatment will occur, regardless of imaging results, coccyx imaging is likely not necessary. 00:08:09Lumbar spine, so these x-rays, research suggests, are the most abused examinations of radiology. 00:08:16They result in the highest gonadal radiation dose of any x-ray examination, equivalent to a daily chest x-ray for six years. 00:08:25And in the vast majority of cases, they offer no useful diagnostic information. 00:08:31In patients under 40, there is almost no x-ray plain film finding that can be linked to the acute problem or that can be treated with an intervention linked to findings from imaging. 00:08:42Disc herniation cannot be identified. 00:08:44Tumors or infections are not usually considered unless there are specific criteria such as atypical pain, intravenous drug use for other potential causes of infection, history of cancer, etc. 00  such as atypical pain, intravenous drug use for other potential causes of infection, history of cancer, etc. 00:08:56So instead, regardless of the findings on the x-ray image, modalities to reduce pain along with exercise or advice to stay active will invariably be the treatment of choice. 00:09:08A lumbar spine x-ray series may be useful in cases of severe trauma, or possible metastatic tumor, or infection. 00:09:16Acute low back pain with, sorry, acute low back pain with radiculopathy is not an indication for x-rays. 00:09:23An MRI would be more useful for showing a disk herniation, but that should only be considered after conservative treatments such as physical therapy has failed. 00:09:33And ankle series, around 30,000 of these were reported every day in North America, and they're the most common cause for emergency department visits. 00: 000 of these were reported every day in North America, and they're the most common cause for emergency department visits. 00:09:43An evidence-based history and physical examination using the American College of Radiology criteria and the Ottawa ankle rules can reduce ankle imaging by 50% without ever missing a fracture. 00:09:55So tiny bony avulsions in the foot and ankle will be treated the same as ligament tears. 00:10:01So because x-ray is not a factor in determining the patient's treatment, it can probably be avoided. 00:10:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:08The cervical spine and the cervical spine x-ray series, emergency departments routinely order C-pine films on all trauma patients because they're worried about not stabilizing a fractured back. 00:10:21Research has demonstrated consistently that patients who are alert and have no C-spine pain have almost no chance of having a fracture.  has demonstrated consistently that patients who are alert and have no C-spine pain have almost no chance of having a fracture. 00:10:30If the patient doesn't lag and has no pain with cervical motion, no posterior midline tenderness, and no neurologic deficits, no C-spine x-rays should be performed. 00:10:41In the case of trauma, you can usually skip plain film and the patient is likely going to go straight to a CT scan to ensure that fractures are moved out. 00:10:49However, a CT may not show ligamentous disruption, but should be more easily seen on MRI. 00:10:55So in sum, there are a lot of things that typically will receive imaging, but from an evidence-based standpoint, probably the imaging isn't absolutely necessary. 00:11:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:14Interpreting images in radiology, develop a search pattern and [BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:14Interpreting images in radiology, develop a search pattern and understand that the diagnosis is going to be complicated by normal anatomic variance, multiple diagnoses such as the second fracture. 00:11:28And the second fracture refers to when we become so fixated on diagnosing a particular fracture in a certain area that we end up missing a meaningful fracture in a separate area. 00:11:42Letter C, variations in how a disease may present, and D, insignificant findings, which become significant over time. 00:11:51So using a search pattern may seem to make diagnosing easy, but the interpretation can actually be very difficult. 00:11:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:02So interpreting images in radiology, the pitfalls. 00:12:07Number 1, we have errors of observation, 2, errors of interpretation. 00:12:13And 3, we can Number 1, we have errors of observation, 2, errors of interpretation. 00:12:13And 3, we can reduce errors by learning to appropriately communicate with the radiologist. 00:12:22So errors of observation have to do with a faulty search pattern usually. 00:12:27Errors of interpretation are the practitioner's failure to link abnormal radiologic signs to meaningful clinical data. 00:12:36And errors in reading images are inevitable. 00:12:40You just have to accept that they're going to occur, and occasionally things will be missed. 00:12:45[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:03:16And so one of the things you'll notice with imaging is that often, the things that you're looking for are really subtle, and so it's right in between those red lines, we can see that. 00:03 08:28And that's fatty layer next to the peritoneum and the abdominal wall and that stripe is the fold of the fat layer as it turns posteriorly towards the patient's back. 00:08:42Now in number 3 over here, what we can see is water and muscles and soft tissue share the same density as water. 00:08:52And many water density organs, vessels, and muscles comprise the shades of gray in this radiograph. 00:09:00The arrow points to the so as muscle as it extends along the border of the lumbar spine. 00:09:08So right in here. 00:09:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:16And then number 4 is bone, and we can see the bony components of the proximal femur and the pelvis and sacrum and the spine. 00:09:27And this picture, we can really see how radio dense or bright bone is.  looking for are really subtle, and so it's right in between those red lines, we can see that. 00:03:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:30I think the most important thing I'll have you take away from this slide was really the brightness of the outer edges of the bone on the left image, that healthy femur, and the less dense center of the femur. 00:03:44And then on the right image, noticing how transparent or darker that femur is versus the healthy femur on the left. 00:03:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:57So number 2 under bone density is textural abnormalities. 00:04:02And we're going to look for changes in appearance of the trabeculae, and changes in mineralization, which result in changes in the appearance of the trabeculae. 00:04:12And so when the mineralization of the  changes in the appearance of the trabeculae. 00:04:12And so when the mineralization of the bone is altered, the appearance of the trabeculae is also altered. 00:04:17So the altered trabeculae appearance is often a radiologic hallmark in the diagnosis of disease processes. 00:04:24The image of the trabeculae is often described in terms like textures such as thin or delicate, or [UNKNOWN], smudge, or fluffy. 00:04:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:39So in this slide, the picture on the left is decalcification due to hyperparathyroidism. 00:04:46And on the right, we have cortical thinning as a result of Cooley's anemia. 00:04:51So on the left, this is a previously healthy 21-year-old man who'd been troubled for the last :51So on the left, this is a previously healthy 21-year-old man who'd been troubled for the last 18 months by progressive loss of strength in his legs. 00:05:02And he was found to have primary hyperparathyroidism due to a tumor of the parathyroid. 00:05:09And the radiograph of his leg shows these generalized skeletal changes with considerable decalcification of the bones and erosions of the cortex. 00:05:19And so we can see here, if we look at the tibia, even the cortex, and we can see what we're looking for is this sort of straight line, and we're not seeing that, right, we're sort of seeing these edges that are kind of rough. 00:05:34And then even within the texture of the inside of the bone here is just normal translucent. 00:05:43And on the right, what we're looking at is this l  bone here is just normal translucent. 00:05:43And on the right, what we're looking at is this lacy appearance of the trabeculae of the upper extremity of this child due to Cooley's anemia, and that's an inherited blood disorder that results in destruction of red blood cells. 00:05:59The metacarpals and the phalanges show cortical thickening and osteopenia. 00:06:05And marrow proliferation results in a loss of normal tubulation, which results in a squared or sausage shape of the bones in the hand. 00:06:14And so if you look at the metacarpals here on this hand, you can see then as opposed to the normal shape, right, they're sort of off. 00:06:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:28And the other thing we're looking at in this image is this lacy appearance of the inside of the :06:28And the other thing we're looking at in this image is this lacy appearance of the inside of the bones here, of the trabeculae. 00:06:37[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:43So number 3 under bone density is local density changes. 00:06:48And so we're assessing for localized changes in the bone density. 00:06:51So we're looking for increases in bone density in weight-bearing areas, like sclerosis, as well as excessive increases in osteoarthritic conditions and reactive changes, which occur when the body acts to contain a diseased area. 00:07:06So sclerosis or normal increases in bone density are seen in areas that are subjected to increased physical stress, such as the weight-bearing areas of joints. 00:07:17These areas of localized sclerosis are actually signs of repair, where extra bone is deposited to fortify the bony architecture to withstand the forces  of localized sclerosis are actually signs of repair, where extra bone is deposited to fortify the bony architecture to withstand the forces of weight-bearing. 00:07:29Excessive sclerosis, that can be normal, so when bone is healing, it forms a callus as if remodeled, but it can also occur during degenerative changes such as arthritis. 00:07:44And reactive sclerosis, that occurs during conditions such as reaction to a tumor or cancer, and the body may lay down bone as it attempts to surround and contain the diseased area. 00:07:56[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:00So in this slide on the left, we're looking at degenerative changes of the medial knee. 00:08:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:09And so in this AP view of the knee, what you should see is this classic radiographic hallmark of arthritis, which is demonstrated by decreased medial joint space combined  the knee, what you should see is this classic radiographic hallmark of arthritis, which is demonstrated by decreased medial joint space combined with sclerotic subchondral bone of the medial tibial plateau, and that's what's in this oval. 00:08:27So we can see that the space here is narrowed. 00:08:31And then we can also see, 00:08:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:35This wide, 00:08:37[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:39Subchondral bone, that wider sclerosis of the subchondral bone is a reparative response to the thinning of the articular cartilage`. 00:08:47And spurs can also result from the repair attempt, and on the left side, you can see a white arrow pointing to a spur. 00:08:55Now on the right is an image of osteomyelitis.  white arrow pointing to a spur. 00:08:55Now on the right is an image of osteomyelitis. 00:08:58And this nine-year-old girl had a six-month history of progressive, enlarging soft tissue swelling at the right proximal tibia, and she was diagnosed with osteomyelitis at the proximal tibia. 00:09:11And what you should note here is how the region is well circumscribed by the reactive sclerosis of bone as it attempts to surround and wall off the infected area, and that's what the arrows are. 00:09:22So that really great, great, shiny part there, that's bone reacting and trying to wall off. 00:09:30[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:33And in B, the CT axial image further demonstrates that sort of reactive sclerosis of the left tibia, and also reveals the draining effect, and that's the white arrow,  that sort of reactive sclerosis of the left tibia, and also reveals the draining effect, and that's the white arrow, which was formed to relieve the pressure of the pus on the bone. 00:09:48And so right here, again, it's very subtle, but you can see that sort of dent right there. 00:09:56So the pus drained out into the soft tissue, which enlarged the circumference of the leg, and that's what we see in this axial view. 00:10:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:10So again, I think the takeaway on the image on the right is just noting how this bone is reactive here, a little brighter as it tries to wall off that area, and especially in the CT down below here. 00:10:24You can really see that brightness. 00:10:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:31So continuing with our ABCDs, we  00:10:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:31So continuing with our ABCDs, we're on C, which is cartilage spaces. 00:10:35So number 1 under C is joint space, and we want to assess the width of the joint spaces. 00:10:41Is the joint space well-preserved with normal thickness of cartilage, disk, tissue, right? 00:10:46Recall from our last slide, you saw on that degenerative change in the medial joint line, that joint space was not well-preserved. 00:10:54And then for number 2, if the space is decreased, that's likely the result of degenerative changes. 00:10:59So a well-preserved joint space implies that the cartilage or the disk is of normal thickness. 00:11:05And a decreased joint space implies that the cartilage or disk is thinned down as a result of  and the spine. 00:09:27And this picture, we can really see how radio dense or bright bone is. 00:09:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:40So this slide depicts media and heavy metals in imaging. 00:09:46And if we look over here first on the left, The lower GI dual contrast medium examination is depicted here. 00:09:54And this normal colon is coated inside with barium and extended with air and so that's what the dual refers to, the barium and the air. 00:10:05The bright white outline caused by the medium allows detailed visualization of the structures, which wouldn't normally be visible on plain radiographs. 00:10:14And the image on the right here, this is a total hip replacement or a total hip arthroplasty. 00:10:22The metals used in the prosthetic of this joint, they absorb the x-rays and cast a  00:11:05And a decreased joint space implies that the cartilage or disk is thinned down as a result of degenerative processes. 00:11:13[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:17So in this slide on the left is degenerative disk disease. 00:11:21An MRI image of a patient with degenerative disk disease, it shows bands of fatty bone marrow parallel to the L5 disk right here. 00:11:32And so we can see this sort of fattiness, and we can see this degenerated disk here. 00:11:39[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:11:48And on the right side, we see degenerative disk disease at the cervical spine. 00:11:53And this lateral view of the cervical spine shows the classic hallmarks of degenerative disk disease at C56, including a narrow joint space, an osteophyte formation at the vertebral end plates. 00:  disease at C56, including a narrow joint space, an osteophyte formation at the vertebral end plates. 00:12:05And so you can see these little spurs popping up there, these osteophytes. 00:12:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:14I think the important thing I would take away from these two images are looking at the difference here in the joint spaces here, 00:12:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:25And compare that with this joint space, and it's the same on the other image, right? 00:12:29And look here at the joint space, and then we'll compare that with this one. 00:12:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:42Continuing with cartilage spaces, number 2, the subchondral bone. 00:12:47You want to assess the subchondral bone, looking for  the subchondral bone. 00:12:47You want to assess the subchondral bone, looking for changes in density or irregularities. 00:12:54And increased sclerosis could be one finding. 00:12:58For example, in osteoarthritis, the subchondral bone becomes increasingly sclerotic as new bone is formed to help withstand the increased stresses directed at it because of the loss of the articular cartilage. 00:13:10So if you recall from a few slides ago, you could see how those brighter areas of bone were created along that medial femur and tibia, as that joint space became more narrow. 00:13:25Then the other thing to be aware of are erosions. 00:13:28So in rheumatoid arthritis or gout, you see very little reparative sclerosis in the subchondral bone. 00:13:35And instead, you see erosions  reparative sclerosis in the subchondral bone. 00:13:35And instead, you see erosions of the subchondral bone in the form of radiolucencies of the joint margin. 00:13:42And so what that means is that it's very transparent and it's not the right response that we saw with that sclerotic change. 00:13:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:58So in this image, the left hip joint space narrowing reflects the loss of cartilage and changes in bone density and bony irregularities. 00:14:08So osteoarthritis is a destructive joint disease that can result in pain, it can result in stiffness, as well as a loss of range of motion or a loss of activity tolerance. 00:14:19And X-rays can confirm the diagnosis of osteoarthritis. 00:14:23So X-rays demonstrate a number of findings in oste  confirm the diagnosis of osteoarthritis. 00:14:23So X-rays demonstrate a number of findings in osteoarthritis, although they're not always seen, and they can occur in different variations from individual to individual. 00:14:35So the first thing that we see here is joint space narrowing, and that reflects the loss of cartilage. 00:14:41So we can see the joint space narrowing here, and all through the side when you look at that compared with this joint space. 00:14:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:51The second thing that we can see is sclerosis, which is present in almost all cases of osteoarthritis. 00:14:57And again, sclerosis is that brightness that begins to appear here in reaction to that loss of space and cartilage, right? 00:15:07And look at the amount of brightness there compared to the right big joint. 00:15: ? 00:15:07And look at the amount of brightness there compared to the right big joint. 00:15:14And finally, there's osteophytes present, so a new bone formation around the joint in reaction to that stress. 00:15:21And then subchondral lucency, which is a focal loss of bone density. 00:15:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:15:36Continuing with cartilage spaces, number 3 are the epiphyseal plates. 00:15:40We want to assess the epiphysis, look for changes in the position of the growth plate or the size of the epiphysis, whether the borders are smooth and whether there's presence of disruption or gaps in the plates. 00:15:54So the position of the growth plate as designated by the relationship of the ossified portion of the secondary epiphysis to the metaphysis. 00:16:03We can  relationship of the ossified portion of the secondary epiphysis to the metaphysis. 00:16:03We can see that in figure 221 in your radiology text. 00:16:08And the size of the epiphysis in relation to both the skeletal maturity and the chronological age of the patient has been imaged. 00:16:17Is there's a smooth margin at the borders of the epiphysis, like a band of sclerosis, indicating increased bone activity associated with linear growth? 00:16:27Disruptions in the growth plates from trauma or metabolic disease can be visualized, and those can be difficult to diagnose and they may require contralateral films for comparison. 00:16:37So often, one of the keys in imaging is symmetry, comparing one side to the other side. 00:16:46[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com ANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:03:16And so one of the things you'll notice with imaging is that often, the things that you're looking for are really subtle, and so it's right in between those red lines, we can see that. 00:03:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:30I think the most important thing I'll have you take away from this slide was really the brightness of the outer edges of the bone on the left image, that healthy femur, and the less dense center of the femur. 00:03:44And then on the right image, noticing how transparent or darker that femur is versus the healthy femur on the left. 00:03:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:57So number 2 under bone density is textural abnormalities. 00:04:02And we IO] 00:03:57So number 2 under bone density is textural abnormalities. 00:04:02And we're going to look for changes in appearance of the trabeculae, and changes in mineralization, which result in changes in the appearance of the trabeculae. 00:04:12And so when the mineralization of the bone is altered, the appearance of the trabeculae is also altered. 00:04:17So the altered trabeculae appearance is often a radiologic hallmark in the diagnosis of disease processes. 00:04:24The image of the trabeculae is often described in terms like textures such as thin or delicate, or [UNKNOWN], smudge, or fluffy. 00:04:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:39So in this slide, the picture on the left is decalcification due to hyperparathyroidism. 00:04  in this slide, the picture on the left is decalcification due to hyperparathyroidism. 00:04:46And on the right, we have cortical thinning as a result of Cooley's anemia. 00:04:51So on the left, this is a previously healthy 21-year-old man who'd been troubled for the last 18 months by progressive loss of strength in his legs. 00:05:02And he was found to have primary hyperparathyroidism due to a tumor of the parathyroid. 00:05:09And the radiograph of his leg shows these generalized skeletal changes with considerable decalcification of the bones and erosions of the cortex. 00:05:19And so we can see here, if we look at the tibia, even the cortex, and we can see what we're looking for is this sort of straight line, and we're not seeing that, right, we're sort of  00:10:22The metals used in the prosthetic of this joint, they absorb the x-rays and cast a solid white image on the radiograph, very radio dense. 00:10:32So any anatomic structures behind the metal or the prosthesis are obscured. 00:10:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:42So in this slide we'll go over some terms for patient positioning and x-ray projection. 00:10:48So the position is how the patient is placed during the radiographic exam, and examples include supine, prone, sideline, recumbent, those are standard. 00:10:59We also have erect or weight bearing, and that indicates that the joints are under the effect of gravity, or under load. 00:11:06The projection is what direction the x-ray travels in in relation to the patient's body and so we have anterior posterior oblique and lateral 00:11:18[  what we're looking for is this sort of straight line, and we're not seeing that, right, we're sort of seeing these edges that are kind of rough. 00:05:34And then even within the texture of the inside of the bone here is just normal translucent. 00:05:43And on the right, what we're looking at is this lacy appearance of the trabeculae of the upper extremity of this child due to Cooley's anemia, and that's an inherited blood disorder that results in destruction of red blood cells. 00:05:59The metacarpals and the phalanges show cortical thickening and osteopenia. 00:06:05And marrow proliferation results in a loss of normal tubulation, which results in a squared or sausage shape of the bones in the hand. 00:06:14And so if you look at the metacarpals here on this hand, you can see then as opposed to :14And so if you look at the metacarpals here on this hand, you can see then as opposed to the normal shape, right, they're sort of off. 00:06:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:28And the other thing we're looking at in this image is this lacy appearance of the inside of the bones here, of the trabeculae. 00:06:37[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:43So number 3 under bone density is local density changes. 00:06:48And so we're assessing for localized changes in the bone density. 00:06:51So we're looking for increases in bone density in weight-bearing areas, like sclerosis, as well as excessive increases in osteoarthritic conditions and reactive changes, which occur when the body acts to contain a diseased area. 00:07:06So sclerosis or normal increases in bone density are seen in areas  acts to contain a diseased area. 00:07:06So sclerosis or normal increases in bone density are seen in areas that are subjected to increased physical stress, such as the weight-bearing areas of joints. 00:07:17These areas of localized sclerosis are actually signs of repair, where extra bone is deposited to fortify the bony architecture to withstand the forces of weight-bearing. 00:07:29Excessive sclerosis, that can be normal, so when bone is healing, it forms a callus as if remodeled, but it can also occur during degenerative changes such as arthritis. 00:07:44And reactive sclerosis, that occurs during conditions such as reaction to a tumor or cancer, and the body may lay down bone as it attempts to surround and contain the diseased area. 00:07:56[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:00So in this slide on the left, we're looking at degenerative changes of the medial knee ] 00:08:00So in this slide on the left, we're looking at degenerative changes of the medial knee. 00:08:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:09And so in this AP view of the knee, what you should see is this classic radiographic hallmark of arthritis, which is demonstrated by decreased medial joint space combined with sclerotic subchondral bone of the medial tibial plateau, and that's what's in this oval. 00:08:27So we can see that the space here is narrowed. 00:08:31And then we can also see, 00:08:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:35This wide, 00:08:37[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:39Subchondral bone, that wider sclerosis of the subchondral bone is a reparative response to the thinning of the articular cartilage`. 00  of the subchondral bone is a reparative response to the thinning of the articular cartilage`. 00:08:47And spurs can also result from the repair attempt, and on the left side, you can see a white arrow pointing to a spur. 00:08:55Now on the right is an image of osteomyelitis. 00:08:58And this nine-year-old girl had a six-month history of progressive, enlarging soft tissue swelling at the right proximal tibia, and she was diagnosed with osteomyelitis at the proximal tibia. 00:09:11And what you should note here is how the region is well circumscribed by the reactive sclerosis of bone as it attempts to surround and wall off the infected area, and that's what the arrows are. 00:09:22So that really great, great, shiny part there, that's bone reacting and trying to wall off. 00:09 22So that really great, great, shiny part there, that's bone reacting and trying to wall off. 00:09:30[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:33And in B, the CT axial image further demonstrates that sort of reactive sclerosis of the left tibia, and also reveals the draining effect, and that's the white arrow, which was formed to relieve the pressure of the pus on the bone. 00:09:48And so right here, again, it's very subtle, but you can see that sort of dent right there. 00:09:56So the pus drained out into the soft tissue, which enlarged the circumference of the leg, and that's what we see in this axial view. 00:10:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:10So again, I think the takeaway on the image on the right is just noting how this bone is reactive here, a little brighter as it tries to wall  takeaway on the image on the right is just noting how this bone is reactive here, a little brighter as it tries to wall off that area, and especially in the CT down below here. 00:10:24You can really see that brightness. 00:10:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:31So continuing with our ABCDs, we're on C, which is cartilage spaces. 00:10:35So number 1 under C is joint space, and we want to assess the width of the joint spaces. 00:10:41Is the joint space well-preserved with normal thickness of cartilage, disk, tissue, right? 00:10:46Recall from our last slide, you saw on that degenerative change in the medial joint line, that joint space was not well-preserved. 00:10:54And then for number 2, if the space is decreased, that's likely the result of degenerative changes. 00 :54And then for number 2, if the space is decreased, that's likely the result of degenerative changes. 00:10:59So a well-preserved joint space implies that the cartilage or the disk is of normal thickness. 00:11:05And a decreased joint space implies that the cartilage or disk is thinned down as a result of degenerative processes. 00:11:13[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:17So in this slide on the left is degenerative disk disease. 00:11:21An MRI image of a patient with degenerative disk disease, it shows bands of fatty bone marrow parallel to the L5 disk right here. 00:11:32And so we can see this sort of fattiness, and we can see this degenerated disk here. 00:11:39[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:11:48And on the right side, we see degenerative disk disease at the BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:11:48And on the right side, we see degenerative disk disease at the cervical spine. 00:11:53And this lateral view of the cervical spine shows the classic hallmarks of degenerative disk disease at C56, including a narrow joint space, an osteophyte formation at the vertebral end plates. 00:12:05And so you can see these little spurs popping up there, these osteophytes. 00:12:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:14I think the important thing I would take away from these two images are looking at the difference here in the joint spaces here, 00:12:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:25And compare that with this joint space, and it's the same on the other image, right? 00:12:29And look here at the joint space, and then we'll compare that with this one. 00:  00:12:29And look here at the joint space, and then we'll compare that with this one. 00:12:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:42Continuing with cartilage spaces, number 2, the subchondral bone. 00:12:47You want to assess the subchondral bone, looking for changes in density or irregularities. 00:12:54And increased sclerosis could be one finding. 00:12:58For example, in osteoarthritis, the subchondral bone becomes increasingly sclerotic as new bone is formed to help withstand the increased stresses directed at it because of the loss of the articular cartilage. 00:13:10So if you recall from a few slides ago, you could see how those brighter areas of bone were created along that medial femur and tibia, as that joint space became more narrow. 00:13:25Then the other thing to be aware of  travels in in relation to the patient's body and so we have anterior posterior oblique and lateral 00:11:18[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:25So these are some examples of oblique views. 00:11:29And when these images are viewed, they can either be done in light boxes or digitally using a monitor. 00:11:36And the image is usually viewed with the image in the anatomical position. 00:11:41In other words, if you have an anterior posterior image of the knee, you want to have the image position so that it looks like the patient is standing in front of you. 00:11:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:55So in this slide we'll talk about some basic radiographic terminology again. 00:12:00So position identifies the patient's position in two ways, in reference to the general body position and in reference to specific positions describing which body part is closest to  and tibia, as that joint space became more narrow. 00:13:25Then the other thing to be aware of are erosions. 00:13:28So in rheumatoid arthritis or gout, you see very little reparative sclerosis in the subchondral bone. 00:13:35And instead, you see erosions of the subchondral bone in the form of radiolucencies of the joint margin. 00:13:42And so what that means is that it's very transparent and it's not the right response that we saw with that sclerotic change. 00:13:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:58So in this image, the left hip joint space narrowing reflects the loss of cartilage and changes in bone density and bony irregularities. 00:14:08So osteoarthritis is a destructive joint disease that can result in pain, it can result in stiffness, as :08So osteoarthritis is a destructive joint disease that can result in pain, it can result in stiffness, as well as a loss of range of motion or a loss of activity tolerance. 00:14:19And X-rays can confirm the diagnosis of osteoarthritis. 00:14:23So X-rays demonstrate a number of findings in osteoarthritis, although they're not always seen, and they can occur in different variations from individual to individual. 00:14:35So the first thing that we see here is joint space narrowing, and that reflects the loss of cartilage. 00:14:41So we can see the joint space narrowing here, and all through the side when you look at that compared with this joint space. 00:14:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:51The second thing that we can see is sclerosis, which is present in almost all cases of osteoarthritis. 00:14:  thing that we can see is sclerosis, which is present in almost all cases of osteoarthritis. 00:14:57And again, sclerosis is that brightness that begins to appear here in reaction to that loss of space and cartilage, right? 00:15:07And look at the amount of brightness there compared to the right big joint. 00:15:14And finally, there's osteophytes present, so a new bone formation around the joint in reaction to that stress. 00:15:21And then subchondral lucency, which is a focal loss of bone density. 00:15:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:15:36Continuing with cartilage spaces, number 3 are the epiphyseal plates. 00:15:40We want to assess the epiphysis, look for changes in the position of the growth plate or the size of the epiphysis, whether the borders are smooth and whether there's  in the position of the growth plate or the size of the epiphysis, whether the borders are smooth and whether there's presence of disruption or gaps in the plates. 00:15:54So the position of the growth plate as designated by the relationship of the ossified portion of the secondary epiphysis to the metaphysis. 00:16:03We can see that in figure 221 in your radiology text. 00:16:08And the size of the epiphysis in relation to both the skeletal maturity and the chronological age of the patient has been imaged. 00:16:17Is there's a smooth margin at the borders of the epiphysis, like a band of sclerosis, indicating increased bone activity associated with linear growth? 00:16:27Disruptions in the growth plates from trauma or metabolic disease can be visualized, and those can be difficult to diagnose and they may require contralateral films for comparison. 00:16:37So often  and those can be difficult to diagnose and they may require contralateral films for comparison. 00:16:37So often, one of the keys in imaging is symmetry, comparing one side to the other side. 00:16:46[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:01:18And so, this is referred to as a triplane fracture, and they tend to occur at the distal tibia. 00:01:24So, on the right is a normal radiographic appearance of a hand of an 8-year old child, and the borders of the epiphyses are normally bounded by a smooth margin with a band of sclerosis indicating increased bone activity. 00:01:38And so, that's fine, that is a really nice one, because you can see how great that is right there. 00:01:46[BLANK_AUDIO]  one, because you can see how great that is right there. 00:01:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:48And this is how they're distinguished from fracture fragments, with that really, really bright band of sclerosis from the increased bone activity, all right? 00:01:58So now, we'll get back to soft tissues from our ABCS. 00:02:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:06So, under soft tissues, number one is muscles, and we can assess the soft tissue of the muscles, looking for changes in muscle girth that might represent muscle wasting or gross swelling of muscle and soft tissues. 00:02:18And so, although tissue densities appear similar on radiographs, because tissue has limited density compared with bone. 00:02:26In extreme circumstances, some properties of the soft tissue can actually be visualized, and gross muscle wasting could suggest a primary muscle disease paralysis, or  some properties of the soft tissue can actually be visualized, and gross muscle wasting could suggest a primary muscle disease paralysis, or some sort of severe illness or disuse attribute is secondary to trauma 00:02:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:48Gross swelling for example of muscles and soft tissues could also be indicative of inflammation or edema, hemorrhage, or tumor. 00:02:58So essentially, looking at the size or the girth of the muscle can be indicative of different pathologies. 00:03:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:09So, in this image, we're looking at disuse atrophy of the quadriceps, and this is disuse atrophy of the quadriceps secondary to a traumatic patellar dislocation. 00:03:20And you can see the shrunken and concave appearance of the soft tissue outlining the thigh. 00:03:26Look at the inferior  see the shrunken and concave appearance of the soft tissue outlining the thigh. 00:03:26Look at the inferior position of the patella related to the quadriceps insufficiency, right? 00:03:32And so, here on the other leg, this is the normal patella position. 00:03:38And on the right side, you can see it's really free. 00:03:41You can see how the patella was dropped down there. 00:03:44And also, even more there, and you can see the bulk of the quads here on this one. 00:03:52You can see it's all these. 00:03:55[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:57Okay. 00:03:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:00This is a really excellent drawing. 00:04:01Bob Ross-like drawing, I suppose. :04:00This is a really excellent drawing. 00:04:01Bob Ross-like drawing, I suppose. 00:04:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:11So, continuing with our soft tissues. 00:04:12Number 2 is fat pads, and we want to assess the fat pads looking for changes in the position of the fat pads. 00:04:20And this is usually a result of swelling and possibly an injury to an adjacent structure. 00:04:25So, although soft tissue densities may appear similar, again, we're looking more at girth or maybe location of soft tissue on one extremity compared to another extremity. 00:04:40[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:44So, in this image, on the left, we're looking at a normal pronator quadratus fat pad. 00:04:51And on the right, we're looking at anterior b  normal pronator quadratus fat pad. 00:04:51And on the right, we're looking at anterior bowing of the pronator quadratus fat pad. 00:04:58So, on lateral wrist radiographs, the pronator fat pad usually appears as a thin, radiolucent triangle with its base attached to the palmar surface of the distal radius. 00:05:10And the bowing on the right could be the result of a fall, a muscle strain, an inflammatory condition or infection, or septic arthritis at the wrist, but that bowing is a result of fluid. 00:05:25So, you can see how it kind of bulges out there, as opposed to this side, and it's pretty straight 00:05:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:44So, continuing with soft tissues, number 3 is joint capsule, we want to assess the joint capsule. 00:05:  position in two ways, in reference to the general body position and in reference to specific positions describing which body part is closest to the image receptor. 00:12:16Decubitus, here the patient may be lying prone supine all on one side. 00:12:23Usually these positions are used to detect air fluid levels in the chest and abdomen. 00:12:28Radiographs can be made with the patient upright and [UNKNOWN] in standing position. 00:12:33And rectal wing bearing/u can establish that joints were gravity and or wing bearing/u independent. 00:12:40And usually if a joint is wing bearing, this is marked on the radiograph. 00:12:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:48And so in position starting with A, right, we have general positions including upright, seated, supine, prone, erect, recumbent and Trendelenburg. 00:13: So, continuing with soft tissues, number 3 is joint capsule, we want to assess the joint capsule. 00:05:49Usually you can't see these well, but they become visible when swelling is present. 00:05:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:55And so that swelling is seen and exacerbations of arthritic conditions, like infection or hemophilia, and acute joint trauma. 00:06:05Effusion from the trauma and intra articular fracture may produce a lipohemarthrosis in the joint capsule, and a lipohemarthrosis is the mixture of fat and blood from the marrow, which enters the joint space through an osteochondral defect. 00:06:22And so because fat is less dense than blood, the fat floats on the surface of the blood. 00:06:27On a radiograph, this is referred to as a fat fluid level or a fat-blood interface, FBI 06:27On a radiograph, this is referred to as a fat fluid level or a fat-blood interface, FBI sign fat-blood interface. 00:06:39And somewhat seen on a radiograph it's a sign or a strong indicator for potentially overlooked intra articular fracture. 00:06:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:51So, this is the fat-blood interface sign, the FBI sign, and this is a non-weight-bearing lateral view of the knee, and marrow and blood that seep through the intra-articular tibial patella fracture, which we can't see here. 00:07:08It has accumulated in the suprapatellar area of the joint capsule, and divided into layers because of differences in fluid density. 00:07:17And a fracture has to occur for this sign to be present. 00:07:21[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:25  occur for this sign to be present. 00:07:21[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:25So, I think a couple of important things we need to recognize. 00:07:28Number one, we have the joint space here between the tibia and the femur, and the we have the patella here. 00:07:34And then note the difference in the densities here, you can see the fat and the blood interface. 00:07:41But the other thing I think that's important to recognize is that, if we look at the contour of the skin here. 00:07:49You can see how it's kind of pushed out, and that's a result of the fluid accumulation here, between the blood and the femur. 00:07:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:01And the soft tissue. 00:08:02[BLANK_AUDIO] 00: ] 00:08:01And the soft tissue. 00:08:02[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:11So, continuing with soft tissues, number 4 is periosteum. 00:08:14And the periosteum is assessed for any kind of reactive process, so a solid reaction for fracture healing or osteomyelitis. 00:08:23A laminated process due to repetitive injury, a sunburst as a result of malignancy, or a Codman's triangle due to a tumor, hemorrhage or other trauma. 00:08:34So, normally, rather than distinct, the periosteum can become evident in its response to abnormal conditions. 00:08:41And you can actually see this in your McKenna's textbook, figure 2 dash 26. 00:08:47And a periosteal reaction is generally described as being one of four types, and by the characteristic radiographic images 47And a periosteal reaction is generally described as being one of four types, and by the characteristic radiographic images. 00:08:56So, look for these types of periosteal reaction. 00:08:58A solid Is a reaction that indicates an indolent or slow rolling process which is seen in fracture healing, in chronic osteomyelitis, laminated or onionskin kind of shape or outline, and this reaction indicates repetitive injury. 00:09:18As in battered child syndrome, it's also associated with sarcomas, a sunburst or speculated pattern. 00:09:26So, this reaction is almost always associated with malignant bone lesions such as sarcomas, and is frequently seen in metastatic squamous cell tumors. 00:09:36The distinct appearance of the periosteum is due to the repeated breakthrough of the tumor, the neoplastic process, followed by a new periosteal response.  due to the repeated breakthrough of the tumor, the neoplastic process, followed by a new periosteal response. 00:09:48And finally, Codman's triangle, where a piece of the periosteum is elevated by abnormal conditions and it ossifies in a triangular shape. 00:09:56And this can be present in a variety of conditions, including a tumor, a subperiosteal hemorrhage in battered child syndrome. 00:10:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:11And periosteal reactions to abnormal conditions appear on radiograph in four characteristic images, all right? 00:10:18The solid and the sunburst here, and then the onionskin, we have these layers, right? 00:10:28And finally Codman's triangle. 00:10:29So, the Codman's triangle, it might be helpful to imagine you have your bone here and something kind of :29So, the Codman's triangle, it might be helpful to imagine you have your bone here and something kind of pushes that bone out, and continues to push it out like this. 00:10:41[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:43And it develops into a triangle shape. 00:10:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:52So, soft tissue is number 5, miscellaneous soft tissue findings. 00:10:57We assess for out-of-the-ordinary soft tissue findings. 00:11:00So, gas as a result of gangrene or trauma, calcification, or foreign bodies. 00:11:07So, gas in soft tissue is an indication of gas forming organisms such as gangrene or trauma, and calcifications in soft tissues can be the result of cold trauma where a hemorrhage is coagulated and calcified. 00:11:21Calcifications also occur in vessels  trauma where a hemorrhage is coagulated and calcified. 00:11:21Calcifications also occur in vessels and organs, for example, renal calculi or gallstones, or calcifications in the abdominal or the organs, those can be seen on radiographs. 00:11:33And finally, things like foreign bodies, such as metal shards, you can also see those on soft tissues on radiographs. 00:11:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:44So in this image, we're looking at myositis, ossificans of the elbow and forearm. 00:11:49This is an AP view of the elbow, and heterotopic bone is developed in the soft tissues of a forearm of this 53-year old man after a biceps tendon tear, and a repair with a Mitek suture anchor. 00:12:04So, the boundaries of that abnormal tissue are here. 00:12: k suture anchor. 00:12:04So, the boundaries of that abnormal tissue are here. 00:12:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:13Okay, this is the heterotopic bone, and then here, you can see some hardware, right in there. 00:12:25[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:02:55And then it's sharply defined, it's a slow growing lesion. 00:03:02[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:04And then the shape is usually longer than it is wide. 00:03:08And that's sort of what we see here too again, if you look at B, right, this is sort of a long [INAUDIBLE] But it can also be broad based triggers for like growth. 00:03:25A really important one INAUDIBLE] But it can also be broad based triggers for like growth. 00:03:25A really important one here though is that the joint space is usually preserved, right? 00:03:30And so we look here at this femural joint. 00:03:33We still have space in there if we look between the tibia and the femur, we still have space in there, you can see that space here too. 00:03:45And the bony reaction, it's, it's usually encompassed by a cartilage cap. 00:03:51And finally, the matrix production is mixed and there's no soft tissue changes and no history of trauma or surgery. 00:03:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:05So when we think about, again, the radiologic diagnosis of skeletal pathology, we're looking at number one, identifying the category of the methodology. 00:04:15The different categories  positions including upright, seated, supine, prone, erect, recumbent and Trendelenburg. 00:13:00And then specific describing which body part is closest to the image receptor as I mentioned earlier, and then decubitus is basically our lying positions. 00:13:10For more on this you can see table 1.5 and figure 1.16 in your McKinnis text. 00:13:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:24So as I mentioned earlier, it's important to always view the radiographs as if viewing the patient and the anatomic position, right? 00:13:33So the radiographs are viewed as if the patient we're standing right in front of the viewer, in the anatomic position. 00:13:38This AP radiograph of the knee is being viewed properly. 00:13:42The R marker and we can see that right here, tells us this is the patient's right  skeletal pathology, we're looking at number one, identifying the category of the methodology. 00:04:15The different categories include, for example, congenital, right from birth, so the presence of a cervical rib, inflammatory having to do with vascular structure, osteomyelitis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, metabolic, such as Paget's disease or fibrous dryplasia. 00:04:37Aa neoplastic category like a bone tumor, a traumatic category like a broken bone fractured, a vascular category such as avascular necrosis or fever, and then finally a miscellaneous or other, which can include things like an infection or osteoarthritis. 00:04:55[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:00So as we look at the categories, we'll start here with the inflammatory category. 00:05:05And what we're looking at in this slide is ankylosing spondylitis. 00  00:05:05And what we're looking at in this slide is ankylosing spondylitis. 00:05:10And both of these images are from a 66 year old man on the left, the ossification of the outer fibers of the disc. 00:05:19The amylose fibrosis and the alpophaseal joints have fused, so we can see the ossification of the outer fibers of the disc here, and the other thing that's. 00:05:38Here's a look at this bonding activity here. 00:05:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:44On the right, ligamentous ossifications and you can also see fusion of the apophyseal and sacroiliac joints. 00:05:52Usually, there's more dark appearing cartilage, but that's been replaced by bone matrix. 00:05:58You can see that in the red  appearing cartilage, but that's been replaced by bone matrix. 00:05:58You can see that in the red arrow here. 00:06:01And then like your takeaway from the right which is really just the amount of bone that's present, the amount of bright image that's present in this picture. 00:06:11And we can just see 00:06:12[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:16That much of a gap in here or here too, and we don't see a lot of smoothness when you see a lot of [UNKNOWN] Going matrix, 00:06:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:32So the next category we're going to look at is the metabolic category, sample here is nutritional rickets. 00:06:42And so what we're looking at in these images is nutritional rickets and a femoral fracture in a three year old female. 00:06:  looking at in these images is nutritional rickets and a femoral fracture in a three year old female. 00:06:50So on the left we have AP radiograph of both knees, and we can see a fracture of the distal right femur with a black arrow right here, and if you remember our ABCs. 00:07:02The alignment here is off, so this is not very well aligned. 00:07:11We can also see fractures of the right tibia and both fibula, and that's at the dashed white pearls right down here. 00:07:20And you can see this one down here [INAUDIBLE] We can also see this sort of fragmented or frayed and fractured metaphyses, and that's at the solid white arrows here. 00:07:35So we can see this just doesn't look very distinct and solid, it's kind of hanging off to the side here. 00:07:42Same  doesn't look very distinct and solid, it's kind of hanging off to the side here. 00:07:42Same with this one over here. 00:07:45So the image on the right is the same individual two years later. 00:07:50And you can see this sort of diffuse osteopenia, as you can see following the tibia, right here, and you can see following the fibula here. 00:08:03We can also see widened growth plates here, 00:08:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:09And we can see the sclerosis and irregularity on metapasis. 00:08:13The arrows point to the sclerotic metaphysial bands due to alternating periods of adequate and inadequate mineralization. 00:08:23That may be due to or related to the adequacy of nutrition during certain periods of time versus inadequate nutrition during other periods of time. 00:08:35Again  the adequacy of nutrition during certain periods of time versus inadequate nutrition during other periods of time. 00:08:35Again, that sort of white space here, I guess that's for those [INAUDIBLE]. 00:08:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:47So once we've identified the category, now we want to identify the distribution of the lesion and whether it's a monoarticular such as a fracture affecting only one bone or joint. 00:08:59Polyarticular, such as rheumatoid arthritis, which can affect multiple bones or joints, or diffuse, such as osteoporosis or bony metastases, which can affect all or nearly all the bones or joints, like neoplastic and metabolic disease. 00:09:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:20So here's a diffuse distribution and this is metastases and we can see why spread sclerosis. 00:09:27 20So here's a diffuse distribution and this is metastases and we can see why spread sclerosis. 00:09:27So again, sclerosis is this increased bone density that increase brightness of the pelvis and the sacroiliac region. 00:09:34And the vertebral bodies of the thoracic and lumbar spine appear of sclerotic with a loss of the pedicles bilaterally. 00:09:50And so you can sort of see, really distinct, whichever bodies looks like there's just nothing attached to them. 00:10:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:05So now we're going to identify some predictor variables that suggest seeing table to dashboard in your McInnes text for some additional information. 00:10:17So the behavior of the lesion, is it osteolytic or osteoblastic or next? 00:10:24And so we may see geographic destruction of areas of bone that become destroyed  osteoblastic or next? 00:10:24And so we may see geographic destruction of areas of bone that become destroyed or moth eaten appearance where there are small holes and ragged borders. 00:10:35Or we might see permeative destruction, where there's very fine destruction through the conversion system of the bone. 00:10:42Possibly requiring magnification to see, might suggest a malignant lesion. 00:10:48Is it osteoblastic, where we have reparative or reactive bone formation, or is it mixed? 00:10:55Number two, the bone or joint involved. 00:10:57So some diseases affect certain bones characteristically. 00:11:01Gout and rheumatoid arthritis usually affect the small joints of the hands and feet, while osteoarthritis will affect the knees. 00:11:09And then the locus within a bone. 00:11:11So certain tumors are going to  00:11:09And then the locus within a bone. 00:11:11So certain tumors are going to arise in the diathesis, while others will occur in the physioregion or the metaphysioregion. 00:11:19And osteoarthritis is going to affect the weight-bearing areas, the age, the gender, and the race of the patient. 00:11:28So the age could be a risk factor for certain tumors And gender may be a risk factor for others. 00:11:34Rheumatoid arthritis, for example may affect females more often than males, as yeas will be likely just the opposite where males are affected more often than females. 00:11:45And then the margin of revision explanation was sharply defined or as a poorly defined A. 00:11:51Sharply defined lesion is usually indicative of a slow-growing lesion, while a poorly defined margin of lesion 51Sharply defined lesion is usually indicative of a slow-growing lesion, while a poorly defined margin of lesion is generally associated with a lesion that's more aggressive. 00:12:01And then the shape of a lesion. 00:12:04So if the shape is longer than wide, it's generally a slow-growing lesion. 00:12:09And if the shape is wider than it is long, it's generally an aggressive. 00:12:15And the joint space, is the joint space crossed, or is the joint space preserved? 00:12:21And tumors don't usually cross the joint space or the growth space. 00:12:24On the other hand, infections and inflammatory processes has instructions on both sides of the choice. 00:12:32And then number eight bony reaction. 00:12:35So periosteal reaction is characterized by interrupted for uninterrupted with interrupted suggesting some kind of malignant . 00:13:42The R marker and we can see that right here, tells us this is the patient's right leg. 00:13:50So the radiograph is viewed with the fibula to the viewer's left hand side. 00:13:56The small letters below the R are the technician's initials. 00:14:02The pathology indicated in the circle is an osteogenic sarcoma. 00:14:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:17Image quality, density is the amount of blackening on an image, and contrast is the difference between the adjacent image densities. 00:14:29Detail refers to the geometric sharpness or the accuracy of the lines on the radiograph for example the resolution, the definition or the sharpness. 00:14:39Distortion refers to the difference between the actual object and the recorded images. 00:14:46So density and contrast are photographic properties that control visibility,  00:12:35So periosteal reaction is characterized by interrupted for uninterrupted with interrupted suggesting some kind of malignant or aggressive lesion. 00:12:47Uninterrupted usually suggests that benign, usually solid density kind of [UNKNOWN] The presentation of an interrupted pattern could be sunburst onion scan or the [UNKNOWN] as we saw in prior slides. 00:13:05We could also see sclerosis or what's called I want to say we have this exostoses or osteophytes at the billing emergency. 00:13:14Number nine matrix production, and the matrix is the tissue produced by the primary bone and neoplasms. 00:13:22So we can have osteoid where it's bony and it appears white clouds light and fluffy density. 00:13:30Conjoined with more cartilaginous appearing or popcorn life and then we could also have a mixed in soft tissue changes. 00:13:39We could see that  or popcorn life and then we could also have a mixed in soft tissue changes. 00:13:39We could see that edema or haemorrhage or joint effusion displacement of fat pads or fat lines. 00:13:46Remember the s of our ABCs, infections or inflammation, which adds density to the soft tissue. 00:13:55Finally, a history of trauma or surgery number 11. 00:13:59A history of pain related to activity may help differentiate between a stress fracture and a malignant bone tumor. 00:14:06An odd bone impairment could be related to a history of surgery. 00:14:11So, a number of different predictive variables and again, for this I'd suggest referring back to table 2 dash 4, and you are McKenna's text. 00:14:20[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00: AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:01:29[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:35So the 4 Ds, radiologists are trained in the 4 Ds of radiology reporting, and they're the basic sequential tests performed when the radiologist reads a case. 00:01:47And the 4 Ds are to detect, describe, diagnose, or differential diagnosis, and make a decision. 00:01:54[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:59So the first D is detect. 00:02:00The first thing a radiologist needs to do, and it's much improved with information in the referral about the patient's history and examination findings, associated signs, etc. 00:02:11So this is the first task of the radiologist. 00:02:14And again, knowledge of associated signs and pathologies is essential for  first task of the radiologist. 00:02:14And again, knowledge of associated signs and pathologies is essential for the radiologist to make the report more accurate. 00:02:23And so what the radiologist detects is going to be included in the findings section of the report. 00:02:29[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:35And then the second thing is describe, and so the findings are described clearly and concisely using medical terminology. 00:02:44It's written for the radiologist so that another radiologist can come to the same conclusion based only on the description. 00:02:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:56The third D is diagnosis or differential diagnosis, and that's the heart of the report and the answer to the clinical question that the referring provider is asking the radiologist. 00:03:06So differentials are ordered in the most likely sequence with a maximum of 3 different  the radiologist. 00:03:06So differentials are ordered in the most likely sequence with a maximum of 3 differentials usually. 00:03:13And again, this is the heart of the report and it's really designed to answer the clinical question. 00:03:21[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:24And finally, the fourth D is the decision, what to do next. 00:03:27Is it important to inform others, and if so, how urgently and who to inform? 00:03:33And is immediate communication required? 00:03:35Are further tests recommended? 00:03:38Are the instructions no further testing necessary appropriate for this particular case? 00:03:43[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:53So this is an example radiology report. 00:03:56In addition to a tool for healthcare providers, radiology reports can enable patients to learn about their health, :03:56In addition to a tool for healthcare providers, radiology reports can enable patients to learn about their health, right? 00:04:03Patients can obtain copies of their reports through an electronic portal or even a paper copy. 00:04:08The report should be designed to increase the patient's understanding. 00:04:13So at the top we see technique, and that's right here. 00:04:18[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:27And technique provides information about what was imaged and the type of imaging modality that was used and the information about a contrast agent, if one was present, and last one here. 00:04:40[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:43The comparison in this example indicates that no prior imaging is on record to compare the study with [INAUDIBLE] here. 00:04:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:52The  [INAUDIBLE] here. 00:04:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:52The findings are where you're going to find descriptions of the areas examined by the radiologist, along with descriptions of abnormalities or normal appearance. 00:05:02Findings may be grouped by paragraphs into the ABCs, and so the findings are right here. 00:05:08And in this case, we have mild straightening of the lumbar spine, likely due to muscular spasm. 00:05:14Otherwise, the alignment is maintained. 00:05:17No evidence of acute or chronic fracture, and conus medullaris and cauda equina nerve roots are unremarkable. 00:05:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:27And, 00:05:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:31Finally, we have the conclusion at the bottom. 00:05:34[ _AUDIO] 00:05:31Finally, we have the conclusion at the bottom. 00:05:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:36And the conclusion is the area where the findings are summarized. 00:05:39And it's also where the radiologist labels the condition and may make a diagnosis. 00:05:44If there are multiple diagnoses, they're reported in the order of severity, starting with the most serious diagnosis. 00:05:52So in this case, we have multilevel degenerative disk disease as detailed above, for clinical correlation. 00:05:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:09So radiology reports are intended for physician use, but patients may benefit from a more readable and understandable design, or someone to help them interpret the findings. 00:06:19And so I've included this slide here, and this is from a study that demonstrates a more patient-friendly kind :19And so I've included this slide here, and this is from a study that demonstrates a more patient-friendly kind of approach to radiology reports. 00:06:28So in this study, patients were much more satisfied when the results were made more understandable and medical terminology was explained. 00:06:37Especially when the patients are able to link the locations on the imaging to the imaging text content and their current complaints. 00:06:47By helping patients better understand the content of their results, the patients have a greater understanding of their condition and the rationale for interventions, and their satisfaction with the entire outcome is usually much higher. 00:07:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:06And I apologize for some of the missing text up here. 00:07:09But one of the things to notice here is these pieces here that are underlined, for example, hypertrophy here at the L4-L5 in the image.  pieces here that are underlined, for example, hypertrophy here at the L4-L5 in the image. 00:07:20This text here refers to hypertrophy, and the patient can then go over here to hypertrophy and see that hypertrophy means the enlargement of the cells. 00:07:30Over here, down below you see disc protrusion. 00:07:34The patient can come over here and look at disc protrusion, and you can see that the spine is intact, but bulge when one or more of this are under pressure. 00:07:44[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:51So this slide has a lot of text, but I included it to remind you that errors do occur in diagnostic radiology. 00:07:58And this is the most widely accepted classification system and the Renfrew classification system. 00:08:05And so there are at least 12 types of  between the actual object and the recorded images. 00:14:46So density and contrast are photographic properties that control visibility, detail and distortion are geometric properties that control clarity. 00:14:58[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:03:14Essentially, we would be able to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of care delivery. 00:03:19[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:25Over-utilization is a long-standing problem in referring for imaging. 00:03:30In this study of 2,051 lumbar spine MRIs ordered by general practitioners, 75% of those studies were deemed inappropriate. 00:03:40The majority of these referrals did not meet the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria for imaging a patient with low back pain. 00:03:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00  accepted classification system and the Renfrew classification system. 00:08:05And so there are at least 12 types of errors that occur in diagnostic radiology. 00:08:12Some include, for example, number 10 here, type 10, failure to find a subsequent abnormality after the initial abnormality was detected. 00:08:19And we touched on this earlier, this is failure to note the second fracture. 00:08:25And so they find the first fracture and stop looking. 00:08:29Other ones that I think that are kind of interesting here, type 5, poor communication. 00:08:34So the radiologist identifies a finding is abnormal, but that finding or that information is poorly communicated to the relevant permission, such as the physical therapist, and so that abnormal finding is not appreciated by the therapist. 00:08:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:55So Brook proposed the following classification as an alternative to 08:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:55So Brook proposed the following classification as an alternative to the Renfrew classification, and this takes more than just human error into account. 00:09:06So the Brook classification starts with latent errors. 00:09:10We have an in-built system or technical faults that predispose to errors in interpretation of images. 00:09:17And then we have active failures or human error, such as diagnostic errors and misinterpretation, or complications from procedures, and they can involve more than one person or be secondary to latent errors. 00:09:32Then we have external causes which are beyond the control of the radiologist, such as a power failure. 00:09:37And then customer causes which are related to the patient and non-radiology staff. 00:09:42So complying with instructions or unfamiliarity with the procedure, resulting in poor imaging outcomes. 00:09:49[ :42So complying with instructions or unfamiliarity with the procedure, resulting in poor imaging outcomes. 00:09:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:55Another classification system is the Brook classification. 00:10:01And this is an alternative to the Renfrew classification, and it takes more than just human error into account. 00:10:08And so, for example, we have the latent errors, which are in-built system and technical faults that predispose to errors. 00:10:16Then we have active failures or human error, such as diagnostic errors and misinterpretation, or complications from procedures, usually injections. 00:10:27And then they can involve more than one person or be secondary to latent or built-in errors. 00:10:32And then we have external causes that are beyond the control of the radiologist, such as a power failure. 00:10:37And finally, customer causes or patient causes.  of the radiologist, such as a power failure. 00:10:37And finally, customer causes or patient causes. 00:10:43It's related to non-radiology staff or patients, and they can include things like not complying with instructions or simply being unfamiliar with the procedure. 00:10:52And so that wraps up this lecture, and, 00:10:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:01I'd remind you to go back and take a look at those 4 Ds, and also, have a pretty basic idea of what's included in a radiology report. 00:11:09[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:01:24And it may also include an AP of the pelvis to assess for fractures or hemorrhage. 00:01:29So the primary trauma survey is a series of images to assist  to assess for fractures or hemorrhage. 00:01:29So the primary trauma survey is a series of images to assist with screening and prioritizing patients multiple injuries. 00:01:37The goal is to avoid subjecting a trauma patient to multiple radiographic examinations and instead to quickly screen them for life-threatening injuries. 00:01:47Usually with a CT scan because the CT in the emergency department decreases assessment time and it also decreases the chance of missing a fracture. 00:01:56And it helps prioritize treatment of the patient. 00:01:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:03Now, some fractures can cause serious complications. 00:02:06So those are fractures which can cause a hemorrhage such as the fracture of a pelvis or the femur. 00:02:13Or fractures which can cause a fat embolism, which is a multiple crushing type injury. 00:02:18Fractures which cause neuro  a fat embolism, which is a multiple crushing type injury. 00:02:18Fractures which cause neurovascular damage, which is fractures to the spine, or the elbow, or the proximal humerus. 00:02:25So although orthopedic conditions are not usually the priority in a major trauma case. 00:02:31If there are some conditions that by themselves require urgent action to prevent serious complications. 00:02:37Fractures that can cause hemorrhage, fat embolism, or neurovascular damage, or immediate treatment. 00:02:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:48What is a fracture? 00:02:50A fracture is a break in the structural continuity of bone or cartilage. 00:02:54In the radiology report, fractures are described using anatomic and standardized terms. 00:03:00So eponyms such as Colles fracture or as we mentioned  described using anatomic and standardized terms. 00:03:00So eponyms such as Colles fracture or as we mentioned in one of our earlier lectures, that boxer's fracture may be used in some communications. 00:03:09But generally, these eponyms are avoided in radiologic description, because they're not descriptive enough and they can be misinterpreted. 00:03:18So here's a fractured ulna in the AP view, and you can see that here. 00:03:25[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:03:27And usually this fracture is due to a blow to the forearm. 00:03:30Now the image on the right is a lateral view and that reveals the head of the radius. 00:03:40Lets's see that here, and the head of the radius is displaced. 00:03:43A failure to recognize this abnormality can result in death of the radial head with subsequent elbow dysfunction. 00: 03:43A failure to recognize this abnormality can result in death of the radial head with subsequent elbow dysfunction. 00:03:51This illustrates the importance of always, always obtaining two views of a bone in an injury. 00:03:56[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:02So closed versus open fracture. 00:04:06So a fracture, as we said, is a break in the structural continuity of bone or cartilage. 00:04:10A closed fracture, the skin and the tissue overlying the fracture are intact. 00:04:17And in an open fracture, the skin is perforated or broken, so regardless of the size of the wound. 00:04:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:25Okay, we have that this is open fracture. 00:04:28So a basic clinical distinction in defining fractures is whether or not the fracture site is exposed to the external environment. 00 :28So a basic clinical distinction in defining fractures is whether or not the fracture site is exposed to the external environment. 00:04:36In the past, the term simple and compound were used because the terms weren't used reliably simple and compound are no longer used, and diagnostic coding terminology. 00:04:46And they've been replaced with closed and open fracture. 00:04:49[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:03:02The bottom is a fracture of the distal femur, but this fracture does not involve the joint space and is therefore considered extra-articular. 00:03:11The fracture line is above the condyles. 00:03:14And so here we see this fracture. 00:03:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:21Right, and so we can also see here that the alignment, [BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:21Right, and so we can also see here that the alignment, 00:03:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:26Is just off a little bit. 00:03:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:35So the second element of fractures, here we have the type of fracture. 00:03:41And on the left, we can see a complete fracture, and on the right is an incomplete fracture. 00:03:47So I think the takeaways here are, in a complete fracture, one bone has become two fracture fragments, right, 1, 2. 00:03:58Now, if the bone becomes more than two fragments, then the fracture is considered comminuted. 00:04:04While in an incomplete fracture, one cortical margin remains intact, and we still have one bone because only one portion of the cortex was disrupted. 00: eness Criteria for imaging a patient with low back pain. 00:03:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:52So what is ACR? 00:03:54American College of, not Rheumatology, this is not correct, the American College of Radiology. 00:04:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:08American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria, ACR, AC for Appropriateness Criteria. 00:04:15So this information helps with assisting in making the most appropriate imaging or treatment decision. 00:04:25In the US, the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria is considered the gold standard decision making guideline. 00:04:34Which imaging modality is recommended for a suspected diagnosis, for example, you would turn to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria. 00:04:43The goal of the ACR Appropriateness Criteria is , one cortical margin remains intact, and we still have one bone because only one portion of the cortex was disrupted. 00:04:14So on the right side here, we can see that this remains intact, while this side here is disrupted. 00:04:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:26So incomplete fractures are relatively stable, and they may maintain their position if stresses placed on them are minimized. 00:04:34So usually, incomplete fractures occur in short bones, also in irregular-shaped bones and flat bones. 00:04:40[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:48So in this image, we're looking at a complete fracture of the distal radius and an incomplete fracture of the distal ulna, okay? 00:04:56And so the distal radius here, you can see one part is here and the other part is there. 00:05:06That's a complete fracture. 00:  see one part is here and the other part is there. 00:05:06That's a complete fracture. 00:05:08And the ulna, we have an incomplete fracture, because look at this cortical margin, it's still intact whereas on this side, it is not intact. 00:05:21So this is a complete transverse fracture of the distal right radial metadiaphysis, with posterolateral displacement by one shaft width. 00:05:32So you can see here this, 00:05:35[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:37And shift it over by about the width of the shaft. 00:05:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:44And then there's an associated buckle fracture of the distal ulna, the slight radial angulation. 00:05:50And so that's right here, this is the buckle fracture, and you can see how the ulna sort 05:50And so that's right here, this is the buckle fracture, and you can see how the ulna sort of buckled over that way. 00:05:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:01The distal radioulnar joint alignment appears preserved, and so that's right here. 00:06:07Well, that's a mess down there, but I think you get the idea 00:06:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:19So 7 elements of a fracture, number 3 is the alignment of the fracture fragments. 00:06:27And so over here in A, we have nondisplaced. 00:06:32We have a medial displacement. 00:06:35We have a lateral displacement going this way. 00:06:38We have distracted. 00:06:42We have overriding and posterior superior displacement down here, and we have distracted and rotated. 00:06: :06:42We have overriding and posterior superior displacement down here, and we have distracted and rotated. 00:06:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:54So alignment position is described based on the position of the distal fragment in relation to the proximal fragment. 00:07:02So non-displaced fractures have some degree of contact between the fracture fragments versus displaced fractures. 00:07:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:18So in these images, we're looking at complete fractures of the right radius and the ulna, and we have one shaft width of ulnar and dorsal superior displacement, and there's also 90 degrees of rotation of both fractures. 00:07:33And so the distal segment describes the alignment of the fracture, right? 00:07:37And so this is the distal segment, and the distal fragment of ulna and radius have moved in the ulna direction. 00  is the distal segment, and the distal fragment of ulna and radius have moved in the ulna direction. 00:07:44It may have also migrated superiorly. 00:07:49So there's one shaft width of ulna and volar displacement of the radial fracture, right? 00:07:55So that's the end of this one. 00:07:58And there's 90 degrees of rotation of both fractures. 00:08:02So the elbow and the elbow, we can imagine that this is going straight into the image, right, straight backwards going that way. 00:08:14The elbow and the wrist joints are oriented perpendicular to each other in this case, right? 00:08:18So if this is going straight into the page right here this is going along that way. 00:08:25So they are perpendicular to each other in this case. 00:08:29Now, this image on the right here, So they are perpendicular to each other in this case. 00:08:29Now, this image on the right here, that's plate and screw fixation two months later, right, so we can see the hardware. 00:08:35And a few lectures ago, we talked about how you can see, even when you remove the hardware, you'll still be able to see some changes in the bone once that hardware is removed. 00:08:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:53So in the seven elements of fracture description number four, the direction of the fracture lines. 00:09:00And these are described in reference to the longitudinal axis of a long bone. 00:09:05So we have transverse here and longitudinal here and oblique here, sort of, and then spiral here, which is that. 00:09:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:22So the transverse is usually a result of :09:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:22So the transverse is usually a result of a bending force, and it occurs at a right angle to the longitudinal axis. 00:09:30And so you have a force, for example, directed this way. 00:09:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:39Then a longitudinal, that force is generally parallel to the shaft of the bone. 00:09:46And the oblique, it's a diagonally oriented fracture and the result of combined compression bending and rotation. 00:09:56So you have a whole bunch of things going on in the oblique, right? 00:10:00So you have again, you have this compression. 00:10:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:06And you have the bending, which is probably taking place, for example that. 00:10:13And you have some And you have the bending, which is probably taking place, for example that. 00:10:13And you have some sort of rotational force. 00:10:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:21And finally, in spiral you have a fracture that spirals around the long axis due to a rotational force. 00:10:28So spiral and oblique can appear similar but spiral fractures have a vertical segment and sharp jagged edges. 00:10:35Spiral fractures heal more easily than oblique fractures because the fragments fit together and when they do, there's greater stability and they heal more quickly. 00:10:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:53So, in this image, we're looking at, on the left, an oblique fracture at the mid-diaphysis of the tibia, right here. 00:11:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11: ysis of the tibia, right here. 00:11:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:03And then, on the right, we're looking at a spiral fracture displaced an overlapping of the mid-femoral shaft on the right. 00:11:11So we can see here is one segment [INAUDIBLE] of the other segment. 00:11:21And so oblique fractures generally occur on a plane that's oblique to the long axis of the bone. 00:11:27And these are prone to angulation and you can see that any of the angulation and where the distal portion of the bone points off in a different direction. 00:11:38And note the sharp edges on the spiral fracture, okay, that's really sharp, and how they might fit together more easily. 00:11:48The spiral fractures are also usually the result of a high energy trauma, and often they're associated with displacement :11:48The spiral fractures are also usually the result of a high energy trauma, and often they're associated with displacement. 00:11:55[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:02So continuing with the direction of fracture lines, we have comminuted fractures. 00:12:07We can see these different versions of comminuted fractures. 00:12:13They're fractures with more than two fragments. 00:12:15And so some commonly occurring comminuted fracture patterns are on the far left. 00:12:21This is a wedge shaped or butterfly pattern in the center here, B, we have a two or three segmented level fracture, right? 00:12:29One, two, three, four. 00:12:33[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:35And then other fractures can occur with multiple fragments, be it several or several hundred, and they're still described as comminuted , women more often than men, and patients who have a history of metabolic bone disease, such as osteoporosis or Paget's disease. 00:05:18A history of a fall from a standing position is often reported, along with a feeling of a sudden painful snap in the hip region and giving way. 00:05:26Acute groin pain is usually reported. 00:05:30In Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, this condition results from an idiopathic loss of blood supply From the lateral ascending cervical artery to the femoral head. 00:05:40Patients with osteonecrosis and Legg-Calve-Perthes disease often report pain in the groin, thigh, and knee that worsens with weight-bearing activities resulting in an antalgic gait. 00:05:52Common clinical findings in children with Legg-Calve-Perthes disease also include shortening of the involved leg  ACR Appropriateness Criteria. 00:04:43The goal of the ACR Appropriateness Criteria is to assist referring physicians and other providers in making the most appropriate imaging or treatment decision for a specific clinical condition. 00:04:57In addition, the ACR is intended to allow providers enhanced quality of care and to contribute to the efficacious use of radiology. 00:05:09So the American College of Rheumatology Appropriateness Criteria is an incredibly useful and important component of decision making in imaging. 00:05:19[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:25Factors for decision making according to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria include age, the presence or absence of trauma and mechanism of injury, prior surgery, pain provocation. 00:05:39And then there are also individual risk factors, such as physical appearance, neurologic status, other imaging results, weight-bearing ability and tenderness to palpation  then other fractures can occur with multiple fragments, be it several or several hundred, and they're still described as comminuted. 00:12:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:50So this slide demonstrates comminated fractures with a proximal tibia and patella. 00:12:55So we can see here an A, this is an AP radiograph of the knee and we can see fractures at the proximal tibia and patella. 00:13:03So we can see fracture fragments here, anocracy fractured by patela, all right,? 00:13:11And B we have an axial CT demonstrating fractures of the patella and the posterolateral femoral condyle. 00:13:20So we can see these fractures here, and the patella we can see multiple fractures here. 00:13:28And then finally at C we can look at this axial CT which shows comm  multiple fractures here. 00:13:28And then finally at C we can look at this axial CT which shows comminated fractures of a proximal tibia. 00:13:36And again, we can see all these little fractures here. 00:13:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:44So the comminuted fractures are usually the result of extremely high energy loads, and these include crushing forces from motor vehicle accidents. 00:13:53Overall, though, in a nutshell, I think what you should take away is that a comminated fracture describes any fracture that involves more than two fragments. 00:14:02[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:05So the presence of special features number five, on the left, we have impaction. 00:14:12[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:16And on the right we have avulsion. 00:14:19[BLANK_ IO] 00:14:16And on the right we have avulsion. 00:14:19[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:21And we can see in this MRI image here, this is impaction where this vertebral body has been smooshed. 00:14:32So, the special features of fractures include impaction, which is seen in A and that's a compression fracture of the vertebral body. 00:14:41And that's the result of forces related to axial loading when a bone is driven into itself. 00:14:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:49The other example is B which is an avulsion. 00:14:53And that's seen in this image where medial malleolar of motion occurred due to the result of an e-version force trauma at the ankle. 00:15:05And it's usually the result of tensile loading of the bone at the attachment  at the ankle. 00:15:05And it's usually the result of tensile loading of the bone at the attachment site of a tendon ligaments, it's occurring right here. 00:15:14With the compression forces, the common areas are generally vertebral bodies here, but the other place it can occur is when we imagine the femur and, 00:15:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:15:30The tibia. 00:15:31[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:15:33And when the femur is driven down into the tibia, you can have, again an impaction fracture right there, along the tibial plateau. 00:15:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:15:50And so continuing with the presence of special features on the right here we are seeing an avulsion. 00:15:56And this is the lateral view of a foot that's an avulsion  are seeing an avulsion. 00:15:56And this is the lateral view of a foot that's an avulsion fracture of the calcaneal tuberosity. 00:16:02And the avulsed fragment has migrated superiorly because the now unattached tendon has recoiled, pulling that fragment with it. 00:16:11And the dotted lines indicate the normal contact areas of the fragment to the main body of the bone. 00:16:17So this attaches here, and this attaches here, and it should fit in there like a nice little puzzle piece, but it's been torn away by the tendon that attaches right there. 00:16:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:16:40So number six, associated abnormalities, subluxations and dislocations of related joints are probably the most common injuries of soft tissue associated with fracture. 00:16:52So involvement in nearby soft tissues is also common, such as disruption of the  tissue associated with fracture. 00:16:52So involvement in nearby soft tissues is also common, such as disruption of the joint capsules and the ligaments and the interosseous membrane between the long bones of the forearm or the tibial fibular syndesmosis. 00:17:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:17:12So here's an example of the associated abnormalities, and this is a posterior elbow dislocation. 00:17:19And so the posterior dislocation of the elbow occurred in this 39 year old man who injured his elbow falling from a skateboard. 00:17:28And A here is a lateral view of the elbow before reduction. 00:17:33And that demonstrates the posterior position of the radius and ulna in relationship with the distal humerus, right? 00:17:40So here's the ulna and the radius, and they should be up this way. 00:17:48You can So here's the ulna and the radius, and they should be up this way. 00:17:48You can also see the fractured fragment over here. 00:17:51[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:17:53Now in B here and C, we can see that the fracture has been reduced and we see now better positioning of the joints, and we also see multiple fracture fragments in the soft tissue. 00:18:08And that's what these arrows are here, right? 00:18:11So fracture fragments here and down here. 00:18:15And also note the swelling of the joint and that's seen best on the lateral view because of the acute trauma. 00:18:22So that's [INAUDIBLE], and you can see how fluffy that is. 00:18:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:18:37So number 7, special types of fractures resulting from abnormal stress or pathological processes in _AUDIO] 00:18:37So number 7, special types of fractures resulting from abnormal stress or pathological processes in the bones, such as stress fractures or pathological fractures. 00:18:48So stress fractures appear as a regular localized areas of more radio dense area and they represent the bones ongoing attempts at repair, right? 00:18:59So we see increased bone activity and so the image appears brighter in that area. 00:19:03The initial radiographs often appear normal, making that diagnosis difficult so there may not be evidence, for example, of a fracture line or periosteal reaction for up to six weeks. 00:19:14So we can imagine, for example, someone with a bone stress injury and they're complaining of discomfort, but we see nothing on imaging until maybe six weeks after the onset. 00:19:25And pathological fractures occur in bone that has been structurally weakened by some sort of pathological process. 00:19:34 25And pathological fractures occur in bone that has been structurally weakened by some sort of pathological process. 00:19:34So that could be a result of osteoporosis or Paget's disease or osteogenesis imperfecta, tumor infections, disuse, etc. 00:19:41Periprosthetic fractures can also occur interoperatively or around the prosthetic components even years after surgery. 00:19:50Bone graft fractures can also occur spontaneously, even two to three years after implantation, and that may not even be related to trauma. 00:19:58The occurrence of those fractures could be as high as 40%, and this increases exponentially in plate patients with plate fixation hardware or patients who are undergoing chemotherapy. 00:20:10[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:20:19So here we're looking at a stress fracture and on the left is the calcaneus of a runner. 00:20:25And we can see the small lucency  on the left is the calcaneus of a runner. 00:20:25And we can see the small lucency in the posterior superior calcaneal cortex. 00:20:30And this calcaneus is actually a common location of stress fracture. 00:20:34In this case, the patient had a history of overuse, having started running long distances regularly. 00:20:41And you can see that here, so we notice a break in the continuity of the cortex of this calcaneus right here. 00:20:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:20:53And then on the other side on the right, there's a transverse fracture of the radial shaft near the junction of the proximal and mid-thirds, so we can see that right here. 00:21:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:21:08And significant cortical thickening is seen throughout the shaft of the radius. 00:21  factors, such as physical appearance, neurologic status, other imaging results, weight-bearing ability and tenderness to palpation. 00:05:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:53So for example, how old is the patient? 00:05:56Under age, an 85-year-old patient with shoulder pain that has been worsening over time suggests differential diagnoses that are different from a 14-year-old with similar symptoms and progression of pain and loss of function. 00:06:11In terms of trauma, presence or absence, when the patient presents, was the injury a result of trauma? 00:06:17Was the mechanism of injury one that might suggest underlying pathology? 00:06:21For example, the patient was reaching for a bag and felt a pop versus the patient reports waking up with shoulder discomfort. 00:06:30Is there a history of prior surgery? 00:06:32If this patient with shoulder pain has AUDIO] 00:21:08And significant cortical thickening is seen throughout the shaft of the radius. 00:21:12And that's probably in response to the kind of training that the cheerleader's doing. 00:21:16So the stress fracture of the radial shaft in a cheerleader, this one is related to repeated full weight bearing on the hand during acrobatics or during training and performing. 00:21:26So the adaptive cortical thickening, or I should say the cortical thickening is an adaptive response to the load that's been placed through the radial shaft. 00:21:37And so that thickening here, and we can see how white, And how wide that white band is, that cortical thickening, and that predates the fracture. 00:21:51And so that cortical thickening is the bone's response to that repeated stress and that occurs with training for cheerleading. 00:22:00[BLANK_AUDIO  response to that repeated stress and that occurs with training for cheerleading. 00:22:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:22:09Okay, so in this set of two images, we're looking at stress fractures. 00:22:13And on the left is a femoral neck stress fracture in a novice runner and on the right is a severe femoral neck stress fracture and a jogger. 00:22:26On the left, we have this area of sporadic bone, this sort of white bone here, very active bone turnover, and that's seen at the base of the femoral neck. 00:22:39This is a new runner with hip pain, so that finding is generally diagnostic of a stress fracture of the femur. 00:22:48And then on the right side, we see an area of lucency, right, a darker area. 00:22:54That's right here, that's where we see that darkness. , right, a darker area. 00:22:54That's right here, that's where we see that darkness. 00:22:58Right, and that's surrounded by this sclerotic bone here. 00:23:05And this is a jogger with hip pain and this is a severe femoral neck stress fracture on the right. 00:23:12So I'll go ahead and erase that so you can see it better again here. 00:23:17And again, what I'd like you to take away from this is just noting this sclerotic area here, right? 00:23:26That bone is very active responding to that fracture. 00:23:30And on the left where not only do we see that sclerotic area, but we also see that linear lucency, that darker area here, this is a more severe stress fracture. 00:23:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:23:46Now  is a more severe stress fracture. 00:23:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:23:46Now this is an image of a pathological fracture, osteogenesis imperfecta. 00:23:52And this is a pathological fracture through the distal third of the olecranon in a 26 year old man as you can see by the arrows right here. 00:24:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:24:03And the underlying pathology here is osteogenesis imperfecta. 00:24:07And that's a disease that's characterized by abnormal maturation of collagen affecting both the intramembranous and endochondral bone formation. 00:24:18So note the diffuse decrease in bone density. 00:24:23The very thin cortices and the flared metastases and a cystic appearance of their proximal ends of the radius of ulna. 00:24:32All right, so we can see this  of their proximal ends of the radius of ulna. 00:24:32All right, so we can see this kind of mushroomy appearance here of the radius and maybe of ulna a little bit too, but we can also see how easy it is to see through this bone 00:24:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:24:55Right, just a decrease in bone density throughout here. 00:24:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:25:05Really a tragic disease. 00:25:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:25:12So, in these two images, we're looking again at pathological fracture, but these images represent the fracture as a result of metastases. 00:25:22And so these represent a pathological fracture of the femoral neck. 00:25:26And so in the image on the left A here, this is a bone scan. 00:25:31And this 26And so in the image on the left A here, this is a bone scan. 00:25:31And this image reveals metastatic lesions caused by breast cancer. 00:25:38So increased uptake of the tracer is normally seen at the injection site right here, right where they inject the tracer, and also at the bladder here. 00:25:47Because that tracer is going to be excreted, but the other dark spot, it's abnormal. 00:25:53And that represents an increased uptake of the tracer by cancerous lesion. 00:25:57And that's right here. 00:25:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:26:01Okay. 00:26:02[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:26:11And so the tumor at the proximal femur weakens the bone, and as a result of that weakening, the bone is fractured here, right? 00:  femur weakens the bone, and as a result of that weakening, the bone is fractured here, right? 00:26:21[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:26:29And so, here we're looking at a periprosthetic fracture and on the left side, we're looking at a distal femur with the component intact. 00:26:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:26:41And, 00:26:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:26:44On the right side, we can see, 00:26:47[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:26:50There's that fracture. 00:26:51And we can see a little bit on the left, right? 00:26:56The component is still intact, but we can see that fracture present there. 00:27:00[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s  fracture present there. 00:27:00[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:01:19So the preformed cartilage is not imaged. 00:01:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:26So elements of fracture description in addition to the 7 criteria that we talked about earlier. 00:01:34Number 8 in children are patterns of incomplete shaft fractures. 00:01:39And number 9, which occur in children are features of fractures of the epiphysis and the epiphyseal plate. 00:01:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:50So these are patterns of incomplete fractures in children. 00:01:56So first on the left, a green stick fracture. 00:01:59And this depicts the appearance of the incomplete fracture here. 00:02:04And the shaft . 00:01:59And this depicts the appearance of the incomplete fracture here. 00:02:04And the shaft is fractured on the tension side over here whereas the cortex and the periosteum remain intact on the compression side over here. 00:02:19So next in the middle, we have the torus fracture. 00:02:24And this term is also common and describes an impaction fracture that results in the buckling of the cortex. 00:02:32So you can see this buckling here. 00:02:35The occurs predominantly at the metaphyseal regions, which are predisposed to a compressive response because of the amount of cancellous bone and newly remodeled trabecular bone present. 00:02:48Occasionally this kind of fracture is seen in adults if an underlying pathology exists. 00:02:55So again, in the torus, fraction of what we're looking for is this sort  exists. 00:02:55So again, in the torus, fraction of what we're looking for is this sort of buckling right in here. 00:03:01So plastic bowling on the far right. 00:03:04And this is the result of the unique biomechanical nature of developing bone. 00:03:09So when longitudinal compression forces are imposed on a naturally curved tubular growing bone. 00:03:17And those forces exceed the point in which the bone returns to its prior position. 00:03:23That bone becomes plastically deformed or bowed. 00:03:27And so we've seen a few images in prior lectures where we see this sort of bowing occurring. 00:03:33One in particular where we saw it in both the femur and the tibia of a young patient. 00:03:39And so plastic bowing means that even when the force is removed, the bone remains bowed. 00  00:06:30Is there a history of prior surgery? 00:06:32If this patient with shoulder pain has a recent history of full thickness rotator cuff repair, then your differential diagnosis might include a failure of that repair. 00:06:42And finally, physical examination and functional test results. 00:06:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:52So we can imagine a patient presents to you in the clinic with right shoulder pain. 00:06:57And the pain began a couple of weeks ago, and they cannot recall a specific inciting event. 00:07:02Basically, they don't remember doing anything to cause their shoulder to hurt. 00:07:06And so that's what we're looking at here, is a clinical condition, shoulder pain, a traumatic. 00:07:14So an example of applying the ACR appropriateness scale to a patient who presents with shoulder pain that was not the result of trauma  00:03:39And so plastic bowing means that even when the force is removed, the bone remains bowed. 00:03:46So plastic bowing is a type of incomplete fracture because microscopic fatigue lines or microfractures are still evident in this plastically deformed bone. 00:03:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:00So, features of fractures of the epiphysis and epiphyseal plate. 00:04:05And these are Salter-Harris classification of physio fractures. 00:04:13And so, here's a mnemonic, Salter. 00:04:15And so, type I is straight across. 00:04:20Type II is above, right? 00:04:22So if we look at the green line. 00:04:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:26Type II is A, and that's above type III. 00 [BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:26Type II is A, and that's above type III. 00:04:29So SAL number 3 is lower or below, and you can see how it crosses through and goes below that green line. 00:04:40And Type IV is two or through, which means it goes all the way from above, down, and through. 00:04:49And then type V is erasure of the growth plate or a crush. 00:04:54And so now that growth plate is gone. 00:04:59So these Salter-Harris physio fractures, so these account for 15 to 20% of all pediatric fractures and treatment is based on an accurate diagnosis. 00:05:10And that diagnosis is critical because in addition to healing, the goal is to avoid disrupting subsequent growth. 00:05:18So the Salter-Harris classification is used to identify the different varieties of epiphyse . 00:05:18So the Salter-Harris classification is used to identify the different varieties of epiphyseal fractures. 00:05:25And so again, number one is S and that's a straight across type I and 5% of fractures are type I. 00:05:35The type two is the above and 75% of all fractures are the above type, 75%. 00:05:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:48Type III is L the lower and 10% of fractures are type III. 00:05:54So when we think about type III, we're thinking about below that green line, below that growth plate. 00:06:02And then type IV is 2 or 3 or transverse. 00:06:05And again, 10% of these fractures are type 4, and 5 is where that growth plate is completely crushed. 00:06:11And that's a fairly uncommon fracture occurring in  and 5 is where that growth plate is completely crushed. 00:06:11And that's a fairly uncommon fracture occurring in 5% or less. 00:06:16Generally, the higher the classification the greater the risk of complications and the worse the prognosis is for the patient. 00:06:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:31So in this image, again, we're looking at features of fractures of the epiphysis and epiphyseal plate. 00:06:38And so here we're looking at this distal tibia and we have a Salter-Harris type II fracture. 00:06:45And the fracture extends through the growth plate and exits through the metaphysis. 00:06:51And this creates this triangular wedge of metaphysis that's displaced with the epiphysis. 00:06:56And so we can see. 00:06:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07 :06:56And so we can see. 00:06:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:00All the way down and over, and you can see this. 00:07:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:08Wedge. 00:07:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:12Okay? 00:07:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:23So, in the pediatric population, the healing of fractures is divided into 3 phases, the inflammatory or acute phase, the reparative or the subacute phase, and finally, the remodeling or chronic phase. 00:07:37And remodeling is much more extensive in an adult population. 00:07:42And children's fractures don't always remodel with great results. 00:07:45Again, it depends on the type of fracture and how that growth plate is impacted. 00:07  00:07:45Again, it depends on the type of fracture and how that growth plate is impacted. 00:07:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:53So that remodeling capacity is really dependent on three basic factors the skeletal age of the child the distance of the fracture site and the growth plate and then the severity of displacement of the fragments. 00:08:08[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:01:32Open reduction of fractures surgically expose the fracture site. 00:01:37Fixation is the method of maintaining fracture fragments in position after reduction in order to achieve healing. 00:01:44All fractures benefit from fixation immediately to provide pain relief, and over time to promote healing. 00:01:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:55Fixation of fractures. 00:01:57An :52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:55Fixation of fractures. 00:01:57An external fixation would include a plaster cast or a splint. 00:02:02An internal fixation includes pins, wires, plates, screws, rods, other kinds of hardware. 00:02:10ORIF stands for open reduction internal fixation. 00:02:15So an external fixation is with a plaster cast, immobilization, or a splint is used to maintain a closed reduction. 00:02:22And open reduction uses an internal fixation, which employs orthopedic hardware or appliances such as pins, wires, plates, screws. 00:02:32And a combination of both open reduction and internal fixation is often referred to by that abbreviation, ORIF. 00:02:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:47So fixation, and here we have three types of fixation displayed on three different patients. 00:02  00:02:47So fixation, and here we have three types of fixation displayed on three different patients. 00:02:54In A, and we have a plaster cast on that side. 00:02:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:02And this plaster cast is immobilizing a distal radius fracture, and you can see the fracture with the arrow right here. 00:03:10In B, we have internal fixation, and this is plate and hardware used for wrist arthrodesis. 00:03:20And this is a fusion technique to relieve pain and provide stability in patients with advanced arthritis. 00:03:26In C, we have a combination of internal and external fixation, and this is a standard uniplanar external fixator used for the treatment of a comminuted distal radius fracture. 00:03:38So the pins are anchored into the second metacarpal and the radial shaft. 00: . 00:03:38So the pins are anchored into the second metacarpal and the radial shaft. 00:03:44The ulnar styloid fracture is also present. 00:03:49And you see that here, that ulnar styloid fracture, we can see this, what a mess, huh? 00:03:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:09So here we have an image of a fixation, an open reduction internal fixation of the right radius. 00:04:16And this person fell from a ladder of a height of only 80 centimeters, and they came in with right elbow pain and obviously there was a fracture. 00:04:27And an ORIF was performed one day after the initial presentation. 00:04:31And so we see that fracture, dislocation of the right radius there. 00:04:35[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:39And the ORIF, 00  there. 00:04:35[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:39And the ORIF, 00:04:41[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:44Carried out one day after his initial trauma. 00:04:47[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:53So fracture healing. 00:04:55We have cortical bone healing, cancellous bone healing, and surgically compressed and fixated bone healing. 00:05:02So cortical bone fractures heal by the formation of new bone, or callus, bridging a fractured gap. 00:05:09Cancellous bone fractures unite with little or no callus formation. 00:05:14Healing occurs via direct osteoblastic activity at the fracture site, also referred to as creeping substitution. 00:05:22Surgically compressed and fixated bone heals via direct osteoblastic activity with little or no periosteal reaction  example of applying the ACR appropriateness scale to a patient who presents with shoulder pain that was not the result of trauma. 00:07:22In this table, if your patient's shoulder disorder was severe enough that it limited their function and after a history and physical examination, you might then refer them for x-ray if you suspect a fracture. 00:07:35If, however, you suspect that bony integrity is maintained, right, that you don't suspect a fracture, and instead that the diagnosis is likely a disruption of the soft tissue of the rotator cuff. 00:07:47For example, your patient cannot lift their extremity or strength testing reveals marked deficits that cannot be explained by guarding, that is, instead of an x-ray, an MRI would be the most appropriate imaging modality. 00:08:00In this case, at least in Arizona, you would need to refer the patient to their referring provider, along with the suggestion to consider 22Surgically compressed and fixated bone heals via direct osteoblastic activity with little or no periosteal reaction or callus formation. 00:05:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:39Cortical bone healing. 00:05:40Fracture healing in cortical bone, as we see an A, a hematoma fills in the fracture site after the periosteum and the endosteum rupture. 00:05:51So we have this fracture going all the way through here and the hematoma filling it up. 00:06:00And the periosteal and endosteal response results in bone deposition that proceeds toward the fracture. 00:06:08So that's what we're seeing right here, this bone deposition, and creeping in that way. 00:06:13[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:16And in C, you can see that a collar of :13[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:16And in C, you can see that a collar of callus surrounds the fracture site, and this will progressively remodel over time. 00:06:26The primary callus is eventually replaced by a secondary callus. 00:06:31And this callus becomes organized in response to mechanical stresses on the bone. 00:06:36Recall the lecture earlier on Wolff's law, right, bone is going to remodel based due to the demands that are placed on it 00:06:43[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:50And this image is an example of cancellous bone healing. 00:06:54And this is inter-trabecular bone formation seven days after a drill hole is placed in the proximal tibia of the mouse. 00:07:02So we can imagine a drill hole right through this area, and this is seven days afterwards. . 00:07:02So we can imagine a drill hole right through this area, and this is seven days afterwards. 00:07:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:15And so we can already see some of that new bone formation. 00:07:19So cancellous bone injuries occur in vertebral compression fractures, and distal radius fractures, tibial condyle fractures, etc. 00:07:30Cancellous bone fractures unite with little or no callus formation, and instead they heal by membranous bone formation. 00:07:37Intra-trabecular bone formation occurs quickly, and healing occurs via direct osteoblastic activity at the fracture site, also referred to as creeping substitution. 00:07:50This method of healing requires that the fracture fragments be in close contact with each other. 00:07:55If approximation cannot be achieved, the hematoma fills in the gap and the healing  each other. 00:07:55If approximation cannot be achieved, the hematoma fills in the gap and the healing proceeds by callus formation. 00:08:03Cancellous bone formation is spatially restricted. 00:08:07It does not extend to more than a few millimeters outside of the injured region. 00:08:11The filling of a defective cancellous bone of a few millimeters width can therefore be slow or even incomplete. 00:08:19This is quite different from shaft fracture healing, which can fill up considerable gaps. 00:08:24So if the gap in cancellous bone during instrumented fixation or joint replacement surgery is more than a few millimeters, healing can be slow or incomplete, and rarely if it's greater than two millimeters in width. 00:08:37[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:44Surgically compressed bone healing. 00:08:47So fracture healing on compressed AUDIO] 00:08:44Surgically compressed bone healing. 00:08:47So fracture healing on compressed and surgically fixated bone occurs via direct osteoblastic activity with little or no periosteal reaction or callus formation. 00:08:58Immediate remodeling occurs as bone deposition and resorption continuous simultaneously as a result of osteoblastic and osteoclastic cell activity. 00:09:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:16So here we're looking at three images of a fracture to a 17-year-old girl. 00:09:21In image A, the fracture fragments are displaced laterally, and so we're looking here at the tibia. 00:09:28You see that displacement in the fibula, and you see that displacement. 00:09:34And B, we're seeing the formation of callus, you can see these lumps forming there, callus formation. And B, we're seeing the formation of callus, you can see these lumps forming there, callus formation. 00:09:43And then in C, no evidence of fracture lines remain, but we do see, 00:09:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:51A residual callus formation. 00:09:54So successful healing of both fractures is what we're looking at here with these three images. 00:10:00In image A, these are emergency room films made after a sledding accident. 00:10:06And so the fracture is located at the junction of the distal and middle thirds of the shafts of the tibia and fibula. 00:10:14In both bones, the fracture fragments are overriding and displaced laterally, good alignment exists. 00:10:21In image B, 00:10:22[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:24These are follow- In image B, 00:10:22[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:24These are follow-up films taken three weeks later. 00:10:28And the image is taken through the plaster cast and it shows formation of callus bridging the fracture gap. 00:10:35So this patient did have external fixation, she had the plaster cast. 00:10:40And C, these are follow-up films taken one year later, and they show good progression of remodeling and no evidence of the fracture lines. 00:10:49[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:05:01If both sides have vascular disruption, then the chances of healing are very low. 00:05:07Corticosteroids are powerful inhibitors of the rate of fracture healing, and growth hormones stimulate fracture healing. 00:05:16[BL oids are powerful inhibitors of the rate of fracture healing, and growth hormones stimulate fracture healing. 00:05:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:16Forces acting on the fracture site stimulate bone healing, but while appropriate stress to the fracture site can be beneficial unwanted motion at the fracture site can result in delayed union or even malunion. 00:05:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:35This is an image of a radial malunited fracture and ulnar fracture non-union. 00:05:41So this is an old distal owner and radio fracture in this video of graph of a 15 year old male. 00:05:48Let's see evidence of a fractured gap and bone resorption at the distal ulnar, answer here. 00:05:55[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:04And there's no callus formation. 00:06:06You also see this medially ] 00:06:04And there's no callus formation. 00:06:06You also see this medially angulated malunited distal radius fracture, so you see this fracture it's malunited [INAUDIBLE] Again the two things to take away from this are this fractured gap here and there's evidence of bone resorption here. 00:06:31You can see how this is sort of diffuse and then the final thing to take away is this medial angulation. 00:06:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:43This is a malunited fracture mid-shaft of the right humerus with outward bowing, and you can also see osteoarthritis of the glenohumeral joint. 00:06:55So this is a 55 year old female with right arm swelling, she has a history of right arm trauma and its been ongoing for six months after a fall in the bathroom and she was treated  she has a history of right arm trauma and its been ongoing for six months after a fall in the bathroom and she was treated at another hospital. 00:07:09The patient indicated that she refused surgery, and therefore the fracture was treated conservatively with an arm sling. 00:07:17This resulted in malalignment of the humerus and healing occurred in this malunited fashion. 00:07:22Malunited fractures cause mechanical changes that can lead to osteoarthritis in nearby joints. 00:07:29And so what I'd like you to see here in this image is if we look at the glenohumeral joint, you can see the lack of space, and we can also see this sclerotic change here. 00:07:42Of course, the obvious presence here is this malunion 00:07:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:00So if radiologic examination during fracture healing. 00:08:  case, at least in Arizona, you would need to refer the patient to their referring provider, along with the suggestion to consider MRI to rule out a meaningful rotator cuff disorder. 00:08:12[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:16I included this slide here because one of the themes that will recur consistently throughout this course is that you must decide whether to treat the patient, to refer the patient out immediately, or to treat the patient and refer them out. 00:08:33[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:35So, if you decide to treat, you're deciding that the patient's condition is within the scope of PT practice. 00:08:42If you're deciding to refer the patient, you've decided that the patient's condition warrants referral to another provider. 00:08:50If you're deciding to treat and refer, this means management of a portion of this patient's presentation is within the scope of PT practice [BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:00So if radiologic examination during fracture healing. 00:08:03The frequency of examination depends on the stability of the fracture and the need to monitor any complications. 00:08:12The least amount of radiographic monitoring is appropriate in a non-displaced, uncomplicated closed fracture immobilized in a cast. 00:08:21In this case, the patient would have initial radiographs to diagnose and direct treatment, and then no further radiographs until the cast is removed approximately six weeks later. 00:08:33And these images would be to document evidence of successful healing. 00:08:38Displaced fractures may be radiographed frequently. 00:08:41Also fractures that demonstrate potential alignment problems or fractures that are at risk for other complication may be imaged more frequently, even at one or two week intervals. 00:08:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:58Compl  at one or two week intervals. 00:08:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:58Complications in fracture healing, there are a number of complications that can interrupt fracture healing or impact fracture healing. 00:09:06And here are some of the complications that can be related to fracture healing, threatening condition such as hemorrhage, or tetanus, complications and associated tissues such as compartment syndrome or infection. 00:09:21Complications of bone at a fracture site such as nonunion, or malunion, or pseudarthrosis ,as we mentioned earlier, and then late-effect complications, such as complex regional pain syndrome. 00:09:35[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:45So continuing with complications in fracture healing, delayed union is present in any situation where a fracture fails to unite in a timeframe usually required for union. 00:09:57Although fracture healing is delayed, the process of cellular repair is present, and  usually required for union. 00:09:57Although fracture healing is delayed, the process of cellular repair is present, and this will continue on to complete union, provided that the adverse factors that are delaying the union are removed, and no additional stresses are imposed. 00:10:11Causes of delayed union may be disrupted vascularity, infection, inadequate or interrupted immobilization, unsatisfactory reduction, severe local trauma, loss of bone substance, or wide distraction of fragments. 00:10:28Slow union may occur in many fractures, even when conditions are ideal. 00:10:33Even though the rate may be slow, this may be an average rate for the given conditions, such as age or fracture site, and is therefore not pathological. 00:10:43Nonunion is failure of fracture fragments to unite and the repair process is ceased. 00:10:49The factors contributing to delayed union if left unchecked will cause nonunion. 00:10:54[BLANK 10:49The factors contributing to delayed union if left unchecked will cause nonunion. 00:10:54[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:04So in this slide, we're looking at a scaphoid fracture. 00:11:07In image A ,we can see the fracture site there. 00:11:12And in image B, we can still see the fracture site, there's no indication of fracture healing, that fracture is still present despite the hardware. 00:11:23And in image C, you see six weeks later, there are still nonunion of the scaphoid, and you can still see this gap [UNKNOWN] here. 00:11:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:41So the fracture is, in this case, occurring through the waist of the scaphoid. 00:11:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:51In A, the arrows mark oid. 00:11:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:51In A, the arrows mark the fracture site. 00:11:53In B right here, the fracture was internally fixated with three pins. 00:11:59And so the the film made in B was two months after the surgery. 00:12:04And as I mentioned earlier, it shows no indication of fracture healing. 00:12:08That radiolucent line represents the fracture site and it's unchanged from image A. 00:12:14And so the hardware or the pins were subsequently removed. 00:12:17In image C, this follow-up film was made six weeks after the hardware removal. 00:12:23And again, as I mentioned earlier, it shows a nonunion of the scaphoid 00:12:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:33Complications in fracture healing can include malunion, 12:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:33Complications in fracture healing can include malunion, where the fracture is united, but an angular or a rotational deformity exists. 00:12:42Recall that slide from earlier with the angulator radius. 00:12:47Pseudoarthrosis is another complication, the creation of a false joint when the ends of the bones in a nonunion become surrounded by a bursal sac. 00:12:57Osteomyelitis, a pathogen is spread from an open fracture or a surgical fixation. 00:13:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:11Pseudarthrosis or false joint is an abnormal condition at a nonunion fracture site, where a bursal sac surrounds the fracture site, and as depicted here. 00:13:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:30And this is an image of avascular  00:13:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:30And this is an image of avascular necrosis where a blood supply to a bone is compromised, which then leads to bone death. 00:13:40And in this image, this is avascular necrosis of the lunate in a 25-year-old man. 00:13:45The increased density of the lunate represents the body's attempt to revascularize and produce new bone. 00:13:53And so you can see this, it's lit up and much brighter. 00:13:56[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:00So C is capitate, L is lunate, the S is the scaphoid, and Tq is triquetrum. 00:14:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:11So complications in fracture healing occurring in other tissues. 00:14:16Heterotopic o  00:14:11So complications in fracture healing occurring in other tissues. 00:14:16Heterotopic ossification, where we have formation of bone in muscle and soft tissue. 00:14:21Myositis ossificans, when skeletal muscle is involved, and fasciitis ossificans, when fascia is involved. 00:14:29Arterial injury, fractures and dislocations can result in vascular injury. 00:14:34Nerve injury, usually temporary neuropraxia occurs from a nerve stretch, but serious nerve injuries usually are associated with open fractures. 00:14:44So heterotropic ossification can occur at any age, but typically affects young adults with a clear history of local trauma or surgery. 00:14:53The formation of heterotopic ossification after orthopedic trauma has been studied most extensively in the setting of fractures of the acetabulum and fractures of the elbow.  orthopedic trauma has been studied most extensively in the setting of fractures of the acetabulum and fractures of the elbow. 00:15:03There's also a high incidence of heterotopic ossification after hip arthroplasty, hip replacement, traumatic amputations, traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury, and severe burns. 00:15:17Arterial injuries are associated with a small percentage of fractures. 00:15:21Fortunately, most nerve injuries associated with fractures and dislocations are temporary, and they generally result, as I mentioned earlier, from stretching of the nerve, and these resolve spontaneously over time. 00:15:34Many patients experience temporary paresthesia as a result of soft tissue edema. 00:15:39This is also benign and self-limited. 00:15:41More serious nerve injuries are associated with open fractures and penetrating injuries. 00:15:47Fractures near the elbow and knee are most often  are associated with open fractures and penetrating injuries. 00:15:47Fractures near the elbow and knee are most often involved, as are dislocations of the hip, knee, and shoulder. 00:15:54Open exploration and nerve repair are often necessary in such cases. 00:15:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:16:02Suspected arterial injury in primary care Generally, we would assess distal circulation in all patients with suspected fracture or dislocation. 00:16:12We would assess circulation as soon as possible. 00:16:15When dislocation or fracture is accompanied by the absence of pulse and orthopedic care is not available, then we would attempt reduction. 00:16:25So one article in particular advises primary care providers to minimize adverse outcomes of arterial injuries by following these parameters. 00:16:35Assess distal circulation in all patients with a fracture or dislocation. 00:16:39Slow 're deciding to treat and refer, this means management of a portion of this patient's presentation is within the scope of PT practice. 00:08:58However, the patient may need or benefit from the services of another provider. 00:09:04And it may be for the same condition or a condition that's occurring along with this one but is different. 00:09:12[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:17When you're considering referring a patient for imaging, one of the things to keep in mind is the financial implications. 00:09:25And looking at this table, we can see that, first of all, conventional radiographs, we can imagine around $450. 00:09:34A CT scan, $2,000, MRI, $3,500, bone scan, $1,400. 00:09:41In addition to the financial obligations, there's also the average radiation dose. 00:09:48And so :16:35Assess distal circulation in all patients with a fracture or dislocation. 00:16:39Slow pulse, pallor, and slow capillary refill, which is defined as more than three seconds, are signs of arterial injury. 00:16:48Assess circulation as soon as possible before radiographic examination. 00:16:53When dislocations and fractures are accompanied by the absence of pulse, and orthopedic care is not readily available, primary care providers should attempt reduction. 00:17:03In many cases, the artery is kinked rather than torn. 00:17:06If the limb is pulseless, much is to be gained and little lost by attempting reduction. 00:17:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:17:15Compartment syndrome. 00:17:16Increased pressure within a closed space compromises circulation and tissue function, and this can result in ischemic necrosis. 00:17  pressure within a closed space compromises circulation and tissue function, and this can result in ischemic necrosis. 00:17:25So the signs of compartment syndrome are the 5 P's, pain, pallor, paresthesia, paralysis, and pulselessness. 00:17:33But these are not always present. 00:17:36A compartment syndrome is a condition in which the circulation and the function of the tissues within a closed space are compromised again by increased pressure within that space. 00:17:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:17:49The pain is generally deep and poorly localized. 00:17:53The pallor is distal to the compartment. 00:17:56And the paraesthesia is usually of a sensory nerve passing through the compartment. 00:18:01Paralysis, permanent damage's likely without treatment. 00:18:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:18:14Life-threatening conditions  likely without treatment. 00:18:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:18:14Life-threatening conditions include hemorrhage, and this is the most common life-threatening condition associated with a fracture. 00:18:21Fat embolism is usually associated with multiple fractures, motor vehicle accident, crushing injury, and fat from the bone marrow enters the veins, eventually lodging an artery in the lungs. 00:18:33Pulmonary embolism is usually related to immobilization and decreased activity associated with fracture healing, which increases the risk of venous thrombosis. 00:18:44A minority of fractures have life-threatening consequences. 00:18:47The key to the management of these conditions is early recognition and proper treatment. 00:18:53Regarding hemorrhage, half of all pelvic fractures require a transfusion. 00:18:59Closed femoral fractures can also result in severe hemorrhage. 00:19:03A . 00:18:59Closed femoral fractures can also result in severe hemorrhage. 00:19:03A fat embolism in a single fracture is rare, but when it does occur, it is usually associated with long bone fractures in young adults, or hip fractures in the elderly. 00:19:14Crushing type fractures allow fat from the bone marrow to enter the veins in the form of globules, which eventually lodge in one of the arteries of the lung. 00:19:23Fat embolisms generally develops 12 hours after a fracture, but can appear up to 72 hours after a fracture. 00:19:31Symptoms are similar to those with pulmonary embolism in the early stages. 00:19:35Clinical signs include a fever, hypoxia, confusion, restlessness, changing neurological signs, urinary incontinence, and a particular rash across the chest and in conjunctiva. 00:19:48The classic signs of ontinence, and a particular rash across the chest and in conjunctiva. 00:19:48The classic signs of pulmonary embolism are sudden onset of dyspnea and anxiety with or without substernal pain. 00:19:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:20:00Additional life-threatening conditions. 00:20:03Gas gangrene is usually associated with a deep-penetrating injury and contamination with Clostridium. 00:20:09Gas is produced from the fermentation of muscle sugars and spreads along the muscle. 00:20:14Tetanus is usually associated with an open fracture, and it's contaminated with Clostridium tetani. 00:20:21Infection stays in the wound, producing toxin that passes along nerves to the spinal cord. 00:20:27Gas gangrene after a fracture is almost always associated with a deep penetrating injury to muscle. 00:20:34The Clostridium  after a fracture is almost always associated with a deep penetrating injury to muscle. 00:20:34The Clostridium group of organisms responsible for this condition is found in the intestinal tracts of humans and animals. 00:20:40The risk of contamination was always present because these organisms are found everywhere, from barnyards to hospital operating rooms. 00:20:50Initial symptoms are pain, edema, and exudate of thin dark fluid. 00:20:55The fluid and bubbles of foul smelling gas produced from the fermentation of the muscle sugars, spread along the muscle sheaths, separating the sheath from the muscle. 00:21:05It can be physically pressed up and down the length of the muscle. 00:21:08The fluid is highly toxic, and the condition can rapidly progress to toxemia and death. 00:21:14In tetanus, open fractures can also be contaminated by Clostridium tetani. 00:21:21And 14In tetanus, open fractures can also be contaminated by Clostridium tetani. 00:21:21And this is commonly found in soil. 00:21:24The resulting infection stays localized in the wound, and in this respect, is the opposite of the infection causing gas gangrene. 00:21:32However, it produces toxins that are more virulent than the deadliest snake venom. 00:21:37Within seven to ten days, the toxin gradually passes along nerves from the wound to the spinal cord, anchoring onto the motor neurons. 00:21:45Stimulation of the motor nerves causes rigidity and convulsions. 00:21:48The jaw muscles are involved earliest, hence the name lock jaw. 00:21:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:21:57So we'll talk a little bit now about commonly missed fractures. 00:22:00And these are usually linked to failure to order radiography,  little bit now about commonly missed fractures. 00:22:00And these are usually linked to failure to order radiography, failure to recognize fractures on radiograph. 00:22:08Subtle fractures that may not be evident on initial radiograph, or presence of multiple injuries, or inadequate patient histories. 00:22:16Fractures are not usually missed by patients. 00:22:19Acute pain is pretty reliable. 00:22:21Fractures are missed by clinicians, and studies indicate these errors are usually linked to one of the following factors. 00:22:28And those are the ones that we mentioned above. 00:22:30[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:22:34So the importance of history and physical examination, and commonly missed fractures. 00:22:39Patient history. 00:22:40What's their trauma? 00:22:41What was the mechanism of injury? 00:22:44And :40What's their trauma? 00:22:41What was the mechanism of injury? 00:22:44And the physical examination is their tenderness to palpation, the clinical prediction rules in the American College of Radiology Criteria. 00:22:52Communication, communicating information from your patient examination to the radiologist may be crucial to helping the radiologist interpret the image without overlooking or missing important findings. 00:23:05So, trauma usually precipitates a fracture, but sometimes the onset is insidious or unknown, such as stress fractures or bone stress injuries, and runners for osteoporosis. 00:23:17During the physical exam, acute point tenderness to palpation over the fracture site is both a reliable perception of the patient and a reliable clinical sign of a fracture. 00:23:28Clinical decision rules are well substantiated lists of clinical patient factors that have a strong predictive value in determining whether a patient has a fracture or not. 00  substantiated lists of clinical patient factors that have a strong predictive value in determining whether a patient has a fracture or not. 00:23:39The application of clinical decision rules helps to ensure that injuries requiring definition by radiography do get image, and helps to prevent unnecessary imaging for injuries for which outcome is unaffected by imaging. 00:23:53So essentially, we're trying to limit imaging in cases where it's not necessary, and make sure we have imaging performed in those cases where it's very likely to be meaningful. 00:24:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:24:07The rule of treatment in fracture management. 00:24:10If suspicion for fracture is high and imaging is negative, treat it as a fracture, immobilize it, and re-evaluate with imaging in one to two weeks. 00:24:18Always err on the side of caution. 00:24:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:24:25So 09:41In addition to the financial obligations, there's also the average radiation dose. 00:09:48And so, here we can see an x-ray is about 1.5, and we've gone over this before. 00:09:54A bone scan of the whole skeleton here is 6.3 millisieverts. 00:10:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:05In addition, as you're considering whether or not to refer a patient for imaging, remember that you should rarely perform imaging as an exploratory tool. 00:10:15You should have an idea of what the imaging will show, and you should anticipate a course of action based on predicted imaging results. 00:10:24So what this means is that you should have formed a hypothesis regarding what you think is going on first. 00:10:29And you should have some idea of what you'll do if your hypothesis proves to be correct. 00:  err on the side of caution. 00:24:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:24:25So if a fracture is present, it will announce itself on the follow up radiograph by localized density changes of effective site. 00:24:34And if a fracture's not present, the patient has only suffered a minor inconvenience. 00:24:38The good sense of this fracture management principle avoids the detrimental possibilities of an unstabilized fracture, and the reality of malpractice actions. 00:24:47Errors on the side of caution rarely have adverse outcomes. 00:24:51[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com :10:29And you should have some idea of what you'll do if your hypothesis proves to be correct. 00:10:34And also, what you'll do if your hypothesis is not correct. 00:10:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:43So as you consider whether or not to refer your patient for imaging, you should reflect on whether the imaging will contribute to a change in your diagnosis or treatment. 00:10:54And a thorough patient examination will help you make appropriate imaging decisions. 00:10:58The history and physical examination are necessary to assist in deciding whether imaging is needed and what type of imaging would be most useful. 00:11:07Prudent use of imaging is informed by a really sound patient examination. 00:11:13If imaging confirms what is anticipated based on all prior information collected by you and the course of care is routinely managed by physical therapists, then imaging results will not contribute much to your initial  collected by you and the course of care is routinely managed by physical therapists, then imaging results will not contribute much to your initial plan of care. 00:11:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:34Consider a scenario where a patient is not progressing as expected or their condition is worsening, or consider a case where you're concerned about some serious underlying pathology. 00:11:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:47A patient with anterior hip inguinal and medial thigh pain, which is aggravated by walking, presents to you in the clinic. 00:11:55This patient also has a 20-year history of taking corticosteroids, and because of this, the patient's risk for osteonecrosis of the femoral head is elevated. 00:12:07After thoroughly considering the patient's history and physical examination findings, imaging may be warranted prior to proceeding with physical therapy treatment. 00:12:16If the patient  and physical examination findings, imaging may be warranted prior to proceeding with physical therapy treatment. 00:12:16If the patient did not have a long history of continuous corticosteroid use, then imaging may not be warranted. 00:12:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:26And so what we're looking at here is a avascular necrosis of the femoral head. 00:12:30[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:03:07And so looking at the radiographs, you can become a little more aware of how the joints of the hand, wrist, and forearm, or maybe the elbow have the potential to be affected by the deformity, right? 00:03:20So you can imagine a bony deformity heals in a way that, for example, in the elbow could limit terminal extension. 00:03: 52Common clinical findings in children with Legg-Calve-Perthes disease also include shortening of the involved leg. 00:05:59Unlimited internal rotation and abduction of the involved hip. 00:06:02[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:06Knee, lower leg, ankle and foot and deep vein thrombosis. 00:06:13Compartment syndrome deep vein thrombosis, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, septic arthritis, and cellulitis, are all serious conditions to consider in this region, in this region being the knee, lower leg ankle and foot. 00:06:30Peripheral vascular disease often includes aching and buttock thigh and calf that increases with activity and improves with rest. 00:06:39A DVT may manifest as calf pain that increases with activity, but half of DVT patients do not experience calf pain. 00:06:48Risk factors for DVT  bony deformity heals in a way that, for example, in the elbow could limit terminal extension. 00:03:28And so you could be trying to stretch a person into terminal extension when that range is limited by a bony block that's obviously not going to stretch. 00:03:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:43So referring the patient for imaging, communication with the radiologist or the imaging service before and after the imaging procedure is critical in achieving optimal patient care with continuity. 00:03:59So that means the idea isn't simply to refer your patient out for imaging and then see what happens. 00:04:06It's really going to be incumbent upon you as therapists to make sure that you follow up with the imaging specialist. 00:04:14And so in the APTA standards of practice for physical therapy, it states that a physical therapy service collaborates with all disciplines as appropriate. 00:04:24And the  physical therapy, it states that a physical therapy service collaborates with all disciplines as appropriate. 00:04:24And the physical therapist must refer patients, clients, to the referring practitioner or other health care practitioners if symptoms are present for which physical therapy is contraindicated or are indicative of conditions for which treatment is outside the scope of his or her knowledge. 00:04:42So, really, it's on you to recognize when you might be dealing with something that you're unfamiliar with in a way that you believe warrants additional information outside the scope of physical therapy practice. 00:04:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:04So, when you request imaging in a referral, your request should include relevant clinical information, a working diagnosis, pertinent clinical signs and symptoms, and also a specific question to be answered. 00:05:25And the American College of Radiology encourages that the request for imaging, quote, should provide sufficient information to demonstrate the medical 25And the American College of Radiology encourages that the request for imaging, quote, should provide sufficient information to demonstrate the medical necessity of the examination, and allow for its proper performance and interpretation unquote. 00:05:42And so that means two things, really. 00:05:44One is that you really should only refer those patients who you believe are going to have a high likelihood of benefiting in terms of their outcomes from that imaging. 00:06:02And you should include information that's going to allow the radiologist to use the appropriate imaging modality and the appropriate views to get information that's going to be meaningful for the patient. 00:06:18So, the American College of Rheumatology also states that the referral for imaging should include relevant clinical information on working diagnosis and or pertinent clinical signs and symptoms. 00:06:33And of particular relevance to the importance of a thorough history and physical examination, the referral should contain a specific question to be 33And of particular relevance to the importance of a thorough history and physical examination, the referral should contain a specific question to be answered. 00:06:45And complete communication with the imaging referral really helps tailor, like I said before, the most appropriate imaging study for that patient and enhances the usefulness of the imaging report. 00:07:01So rather than simply requesting an x-ray of a patient's elbow, providing information such as suspicion of radial head fracture based on whatever the patient's medical history is, and based on your physical test and measures results, which you would also include in the report. 00:07:20That information can assist in the selection process of the imaging modality and the radiographic views. 00:07:29And so, the imaging is really going to be enhanced with the radiologist being better informed by you of the suspected specific anatomy that you'd like them to look at. 00:07:43So improving the availability of the clinical history and  specific anatomy that you'd like them to look at. 00:07:43So improving the availability of the clinical history and other relevant patient information has been cited in a number of different studies as a measure for improving the diagnostic process. 00:07:55And you can also provide your patients with an explanation of tests that you're ordering and why you're ordering them. 00:08:02And you can explain to them the purpose of the test and maybe what you expect to find, and how your treatment plan may change, or their expectations may change, based on the imaging results. 00:08:15Also make sure when you do describe your concerns in a letter to your referral source, that you describe them in a succinct approach. 00:08:29And that you explain that the symptoms aren't consistent with what you would expect. 00:08:33Or that those symptoms may be inconsistent with some group of words that might be useful, like inconsistent with musculoske 33Or that those symptoms may be inconsistent with some group of words that might be useful, like inconsistent with musculoskeletal pathology, or inconsistent with neuromusculoskeletal pathology, etc. 00:08:50But something to sort of hint that additional medical specialization may be needed in order to uncover whatever is actually going on. 00:09:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:07What about the negative consequences of imaging? 00:09:10These are things that you also need to weigh as you decide whether or not to refer that patient back for additional medical evaluation. 00:09:20One is the idea of medicalization. 00:09:23And this means a negative impact on the patient's psychosocial status, possible negative impact on outcomes related to their medical condition as a result of additional medical studies. 00:09:38So we know that low back pain imaging research consistently shows a delay in return to work and lower . 00:09:38So we know that low back pain imaging research consistently shows a delay in return to work and lower functional outcomes versus no imaging for the same patients. 00:09:51Second, exposure to ionizing radiation. 00:09:54So you have to monitor over time the cumulative doses or dosage of ionizing radiation, because that effect is cumulative. 00:10:05And finally, a negative consequence of imaging is the potential costs. 00:10:12So, back in the day, for me, it's oh, 2005, 2006, I worked with a group of surgeons, and we had an MRI machine in the office. 00:10:24And at that time, an MRI typically cost around $1,500 to $1,700. 00:10:31And so you can imagine co-pays, or even those cases where a patient may not have insurance to cover the cost of imaging, that's a really important factor to  or even those cases where a patient may not have insurance to cover the cost of imaging, that's a really important factor to consider as you decide whether or not to refer that patient. 00:10:48It's not the most important factor, right? 00:10:51Obviously the most important factor is going to be the patient's health and long-term, functional outcome, and ability to return to their usual kinds of life activities. 00:11:04But cost is something that really needs to be considered. 00:11:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:12Interpretation and communication of the imaging results. 00:11:17So your patient has come back and they have their imaging, and the imaging is in their electronic medical record and you can see those images. 00:11:29So the question becomes, do you then look at the images and provide a diagnosis to that patient, right? 00:11:37So the , do you then look at the images and provide a diagnosis to that patient, right? 00:11:37So the patient hasn't received the diagnosis from the radiologist yet. 00:11:42And so, medically and legally, the interpretation of the images is the purview of the radiologist. 00:11:49But PTs, by virtue of their education, training and experience should be able to recognize and understand normal anatomy, including the anatomy associated with usual lifespan changes, or anatomic variance, and then contrast that to abnormal anatomy. 00:12:08But the comprehensive interpretation and description of that anatomy is outside of the current scope of PT practice. 00:12:19Which essentially means that it's probably not a great idea if you have those imaging findings and you don't have a radiologist interpretation along with those findings, all you have is the imaging, to use that imaging to provide a diagnosis to that patient. 00:12:36That is outside  have is the imaging, to use that imaging to provide a diagnosis to that patient. 00:12:36That is outside of your scope of practice, medically and legally. 00:12:42That you really need to wait for the radiologist to interpret the imaging study. 00:12:50So you have to recognize and maintain the practice boundaries regarding interpreting medical imaging. 00:12:57And so, once you have that interpretation from the radiologist, this allows for educating the patient regarding their imaging results. 00:13:05Including what those results mean and the context of each patient's age, gender, and lifestyle, and symptoms, etc. 00:13:13And the physical therapists can also provide reassurance, such as helpful contextual information to the patient to improve the understanding of their imaging results. 00:13:24And that leads to a better informed patient without the potentially negative influences associated with the imaging results, right, or medicalization. 00:13  activity, but half of DVT patients do not experience calf pain. 00:06:48Risk factors for DVT include recent surgery, malignancy, trauma, prolonged immobilization and pregnancy. 00:06:57Peripheral vascular disease. 00:06:59Usually can be sussed out by looking at pedal pulses and whether they're decreased and also looking for wounds and sores on the toes or feet of patients. 00:07:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:12Continuing with knee, lower leg, ankle, and foot, compartment syndrome. 00:07:16Compartment syndrome is a result of swelling inside a connective tissue compartment. 00:07:21Usually it's a result of trauma or a rapid increase in physical activity. 00:07:26Symptoms of compartment syndrome include pain when a stretch is applied to the involved muscle. 00:07:32Keep in mind the six Ps of compartment syndrome, pain  to a better informed patient without the potentially negative influences associated with the imaging results, right, or medicalization. 00:13:33And so that's where it's really important for you to be able to look at an image and at least have some idea of what's going on in that image, right? 00:13:42In this case, you're not providing a diagnosis, but by going over what you see in the image and incorporating that with the radiologist's interpretation of the image, the patient can then become better informed and more comfortable with what's being seen in that image or the information contained in that image. 00:14:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:09So routine radiographic examination results can be positive for the suspected diagnosis, negative for the suspected diagnosis. 00:14:19Negative for one diagnosis, but raising suspicion for another diagnosis. 00:14:24Or they could be inconclusive and you could require additional imaging , but raising suspicion for another diagnosis. 00:14:24Or they could be inconclusive and you could require additional imaging to confirm or rule out the suspected diagnosis. 00:14:33And that could actually be mentioned by the radiologist in their follow up. 00:14:38And another possible alternative here is that your initial suspicion was wrong. 00:14:45So, in this case, the images are negative for the pathologic changes that you suspected, but the patient still does not improve with physical therapy. 00:14:54And so the imaging is performed again one month later, demonstrating a stress fracture, for example, at the talar neck, and the patient is referred for surgery. 00:15:04So what I'm kind of getting it, there is that you may have a patient who has some pathology that is present. 00:15:14But it's present in a way that's not been picked up by the imaging, and over time  00:15:14But it's present in a way that's not been picked up by the imaging, and over time the size or the intensity of that pathology grows. 00:15:27So, in this example, the fracture size grows and a month later it's large enough that it actually does show up on the imaging. 00:15:38So, you could imagine a patient comes to see you at the clinic and they say that they stepped on the fold of a towel getting out of the shower, resulting in severe pain along the bottom and outside of their foot. 00:15:49And then after completing this patient's history and physical examination, you're worried that maybe they sustained a fracture to their fifth metatarsal. 00:16:00So after talking about this with your patient, you refer the patient for a radiographic examination to rule out that fracture the fifth metatarsal. 00:16:09So, once the patient receives radiographic examination and  rule out that fracture the fifth metatarsal. 00:16:09So, once the patient receives radiographic examination and the results are interpreted by a radiologist, those results are going to include one of the following things that we mentioned before, right? 00:16:19Positive for the suspected diagnosis, negative for one diagnosis, but now there's a suspicion of something else, inconclusive. 00:16:28And then potentially wrong initial suspicion. 00:16:31[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:16:36So when you're speaking with your patient about your imaging results, explain to your patient the results that are relevant to them. 00:16:44You don't need to explain everything you know about imaging and attempt to impress them. 00:16:50And in this slide, I have a little tiny quote that says, you shouldn't tell an audience everything you know. 00:16:57That was an effort to impress them.  says, you shouldn't tell an audience everything you know. 00:16:57That was an effort to impress them. 00:17:00Instead, you should tell them what they need to know. 00:17:03And that's an effort to teach them. 00:17:05And so your goal is to take something that's potentially scary or intimidating and translate it in a way for that patient that allows them to understand the information. 00:17:19And if you do it really well, it allows the patient to become more comfortable with the material contained in that imaging. 00:17:28And more willing to sort of move forward with whatever treatment you decide it's going to be appropriate. 00:17:35So the PT should know when to order diagnostic imaging and how to communicate effectively with the radiologist. 00:17:44And the PT may not have the primary responsibility to interpret the images, but you should be able to identify and manage clinically 44And the PT may not have the primary responsibility to interpret the images, but you should be able to identify and manage clinically relevant findings. 00:17:55And to be effective, you have to establish lines of communication with the radiologist, with the patient, front office staff, and you have to build relationships with radiologists and other specialists. 00:18:07So the communication between the physical therapist and the radiologist may be required to determine the next steps after imaging. 00:18:15So, think about scheduling a follow-up visit for your patient as soon as possible after the results of an imaging study are available, or communicate those results by telephone. 00:18:28[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com00:03:23So this is an X-ray. 00:03:26And so we can see the contrast material here in A. 00  this is an X-ray. 00:03:26And so we can see the contrast material here in A. 00:03:30I could see it here and be here, down here, but there's a space here. 00:03:39And so from the radiograph, we can see that something's going on. 00:03:42There's a space, and it's not continuous that flow of contrast material, right? 00:03:47It doesn't flow continuously from here, all the way down, something's interrupting that flow.

reformatted image and D is a sagittal reformat. 00:04:11And there's normal contrast filling the fecal space  image and D is a sagittal reformat. 00:04:11And there's normal contrast filling the fecal space at all areas except at L1. 00:04:20And so when we look up here at L1, there's a bony defect that impinges on the fecal sac and indents the column of contrast. 00:04:31And so that, if we look at image D right here that's occurring right here. 00:04:38So we can see this is really bright area because see how it's coming into the fecal sac, boy I really messed that up there we go. 00:04:46So you can see that now hopefully. 00:04:51And we can also look at C, and we can see here that we have contrast coming down here. 00:04:58And then there's a broken area. 00:05:00Okay, so the CT gives us a little more information than just  then there's a broken area. 00:05:00Okay, so the CT gives us a little more information than just the radiography. 00:05:10And so the other thing that I think is important here is that you can actually see the conus medullaris of the spinal cord and the star right here. 00:05:19[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:22And then, down here you can actually see the Cotter going down there. 00:05:30So the advantage of the CT is the direct visualization of the soft tissues, and you can actually see the cause of the impingement, right? 00:05:38We can actually see this area right here. 00:05:45And if we look up here, all we can see is that, there's something going on so with with the Radiography essentially the take home I think here is with the radio radiography. 00:05:56We  with the Radiography essentially the take home I think here is with the radio radiography. 00:05:56We get sort of a general idea that yes, something's wrong. 00:06:00And with the CT, we can actually see okay, there's something going wrong and it looks like it's occurring here at L one. 00:06:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:12So, another common musculoskeletal imaging study is tomography and conventional tomography or body section radiography. 00:06:21Conventional tomography is the radiographic evaluation of one plane of the body. 00:06:27And the depth can be modified by adjusting the equipment a little bit. 00:06:33And the principle of dimensional tomography is that you have an X-ray tube and the film moves in an opposite direction from the X-ray tube. 00:06:43Right, so, here we have 1.1 Symptom InvestigationEffects00:00:00[MUSIC] 00:00:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:10Hi and welcome to lecture 1.1 symptom investigation. 00:00:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:24The objectives here for lecture 1.1 are to, let's see here, 00:00:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:35Summarize why a body diagram may provide useful information, describe the use of open and closed-ended questions as a component of symptom investigation. 00:00:47Describe how knowledge of potential pain location patterns associated with viscera, can be beneficial and how it can also be confounding. 00:00:56And finally, identify three questions you might ask a patient regarding the onset of their symptoms and describe the appropriate time frame over which to assess changes in their symptoms. 00:01:09[BL  of their symptoms and describe the appropriate time frame over which to assess changes in their symptoms. 00:01:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:13Symptoms investigation. 00:01:16So we use a body diagram for noting the exact location of symptoms and descriptors of the symptoms. 00:01:23For example, aching or burning or shooting pains, as well as peristysia, numbness, and weakness. 00:01:30We try to use open-ended questions to avoid leading or biasing the conversations. 00:01:35So examples might include things like, how are you feeling today? 00:01:38What brings you in today? 00:01:39What seems to be bothering you the most today? 00:01:42Those are examples of open-ended questions. 00:01:45The answer could prompt you to ask, are you more sore today than usual or does your pain move around :01:45The answer could prompt you to ask, are you more sore today than usual or does your pain move around or does your pain increase or decrease in intensity? 00:01:54The authors of your Boston Notebook recommend asking do you have symptoms anywhere else? 00:02:00I'm generally more cautious about this, I may return to this question eventually, but to avoid confusion or over complication, initially the focus is on the patient's chief complaint at least in my experience. 00:02:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:23Symptom investigation, follow up questions. 00:02:26So ask follow up questions to help rule out potential diagnoses, noting other complaints or symptoms could be useful here. 00:02:35As you become experience, screen at least one joint or body region above, and one joint or body region below the patient's area of chief complaint. 00:02:46So the patient with low back  one joint or body region below the patient's area of chief complaint. 00:02:46So the patient with low back pain states my back hurts. 00:02:49A follow-up question may be have you experienced any numbness or tingling in either leg. 1.1 Symptom InvestigationEffects00:00:00[MUSIC] 00:00:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:10Hi and welcome to lecture 1.1

1.2  The Low Back and Lower Extremities; Regional Pain Patterns and Associated Disorders00:00:01Lecture 1.2, regional pain patterns and associated diseases and disorders, low back and lower extremities. 00:00:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:12So the objectives here are to identify 4 forms you might give to a patient with low back pain to provide additional information about that patient's condition. 00:00:23Describe at least two non-musculoskeletal causes of low back pain and under what circumstances you might reevaluate a musculoskeletal cause of labaquine. 00:00:34Describe symptoms which might lead you to include cauda equina in your list of differential diagnoses. 00:00:42Identify five potentially serious conditions which may mimic less serious musculoskeletal conditions in the pelvis, hip, and thigh. 00:00:52And finally, identify  musculoskeletal conditions in the pelvis, hip, and thigh. 00:00:52And finally, identify five potentially serious conditions which may mimic less serious musculoskeletal conditions in the knee, lower leg, ankle, and foot. 00:01:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:06Low back pain questionnaires and forms. 00:01:09So some of these forms include the modified oswestry low back pain disability questionnaire. 00:01:15Usually you'll see that abbreviated and this is an outcome measure. 00:01:18Another one is the Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire. 00:01:21Again, this is usually abbreviated FABQ. 00:01:26Common Medical History Intake Forms, and then finally a Red Flag Screening Form could be included, and we'll learn more about these as the class progresses. 00:01:36So a patient with low back pain presenting  habits as well as saddle paresthesia and lower extremity weakness can be useful. 00:03:26A positive response to any of these questions increases the suspicion that the patient has cauda equina syndrome. 00:03:33You can follow these inquiries with a physical examination assessing sensory integrity of the perianal and perineal areas, as well as the L4, 5, and S1 dermatomes. 00:03:45You can also assess motor integrity of L4, the quadriceps and tibialis anterior or L5 and S1 musculature. 00:03:54[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:59Pelvis, hip and thigh. 00:04:02Colon cancer, femoral neck fracture, osteonecrosis, Legg-Calve-Perthes, and slipped capital femoral epiphysis can all mimic common musculoskeletal disorders of the pelvis, hip , and slipped capital femoral epiphysis can all mimic common musculoskeletal disorders of the pelvis, hip and thigh. 00:04:17In older populations, proximal femur fractures become increasingly likely. 00:04:22Patient demographics, age, sex, etc, and a detailed health history are important.   and we'll learn more about these as the class progresses. 00:01:36So a patient with low back pain presenting to your clinic may be given multiple forms to fill out to try and obtain as much useful information about the case as possible. 00:01:48Low back pain, cause of pain. 00:01:51If a patient is over 55 and is failing to improve, it may be appropriate to consider non musculoskeletal causes of the low back pain. 00:02:00Or, it may be appropriate to inquire about an infection as the cause of the patient's low back pain. 00:02:07If the patient notes that their comfort does not change in any position, the likelihood that the pain is not musculoskeletal in origin increases. 00:02:17So asking the patient about a history of trauma, osteoporosis, or other disorder that may decrease bone density may help you rule out spinal fracture as a cause of , osteoporosis, or other disorder that may decrease bone density may help you rule out spinal fracture as a cause of the patient's pain. 00:02:30So a physical therapist asks the 55 year old patient the following questions to increase or decrease, there's suspicion that this patient's low back pain is caused by cancer. 00:02:42Do you have a history of cancer? 00:02:44If so, what type of cancer? 00:02:47Have you recently lost weight, even though you have not been attempting to eat less or exercise more? 00:02:52If you have, how much weight have you lost? 00:02:55When asking about infection, questions such as, have you recently had a fever? 00:03:00Or have you recently taken antibiotics for an infection or have you been diagnosed with an immunosuppressive disorder can all provide you with useful information. 00:03:09[BLANK_AUD  with an immunosuppressive disorder can all provide you with useful information. 00:03:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:14Cauda equina, to rule out cauda equina, asking about changes in bowel or bladder habits as well as saddle paresthesia and lower extremity weakness can be useful. 00:03:26A positive response to any of these questions increases the suspicion that the patient has cauda equina syndrome. 00:03:33You can follow these inquiries with a physical examination assessing sensory integrity of the perianal and perineal areas, as well as the L4, 5, and S1 dermatomes. 00:03:45You can also assess motor integrity of L4, the quadriceps and tibialis anterior or L5 and S1 musculature. 00:03:54[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:59Pelvis, hip and thigh.  00:03:54[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:59Pelvis, hip and thigh. 00:04:02Colon cancer, femoral neck fracture, osteonecrosis, Legg-Calve-Perthes, and slipped capital femoral epiphysis can all mimic common musculoskeletal disorders of the pelvis, hip and

Thoracic and Trunk Regions; Regional Pain Patterns and Associated Disorders00:00:02Hi there, so continuing with Lecture 1.3 on regional pain patterns and associated disorders, we'll now be focusing on the thoracic and trunk region. 00:00:14So the objectives for this lecture include identify four general non-musculoskeletal conditions. 00:00:22Changing the color here, which may produce thoracic trunk pain. 00:00:26Define angina, describe at least three risk factors and describe the difference between stable and unstable angina. 00:00:34Provide a general definition of each of the following, pericarditis, pulmonary embolus, pleurisy, and cholecystitis. 00:00:43Identify symptoms of non-duodenal ulcers which may be associated with malignancy. 00:00:49Describe symptoms which may duodenal ulcers which may be associated with malignancy. 00:00:49Describe symptoms which may be associated with pyelonephritis and kidney stones. 00:00:55Thoracic pain, cardiac and pulmonary disorders. 00:00:59Cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and urogenital conditions may recreate pain in this region. 00:01:07Myocardial infarction may feature angina, left arm pain, epigastric, midthoracic spine pain, right shoulder pain, neck, jaw, or tooth pain. 00:01:201 in 3 patients, however, may not experience chest pain. 00:01:25Dyspnea, nausea, palpitations, or syncope may be the only symptoms patients present with. 00:01:33Risk factors include, a history of diabetes, age, being female, nonwhite, a history of congestive heart failure or a history of  a predictable pattern and does not respond to nitroglycerin. 00:01:53Individuals experiencing unstable angina must be closely monitored. 00:01:57Signs suggesting myocardial infarction such as subternal squeezing or crushing pressure, pain radiating into both arms, shortness of breath, pallor, diaphoresis. 00:02:08Or angina lasting more than thirty minutes, should alert the therapist that immediate transportation of the patient to an emergency department or coronary care facility is indicated. 00:02:21Thoracic pain continued, pericarditis is an inflammation of the pericardium and symptoms may include left shoulder and arm pain. 00:02:29And a pulmonary embolus and blood clot is involved in this can produce substernal shoulder or upper abdominal pain. 00:02:38Pleurisy and pneumothorax are 2 other conditions that may cause chest pain. 00:02:44With per leurisy and pneumothorax are 2 other conditions that may cause chest pain. 00:02:44With pericarditis, inflammation prevents complete expansion of the heart, resulting in less blood leaving the heart, to make up for the reduced stroke volume and to get enough oxygen to the tissues, the heart beats faster. 00:02:58If increased heart rate cannot compensate enough, the individual may start to breathe heavily and the veins in the neck may distend and blood pressure may decrease drastically during inhalation. 00:03:09This condition is termed cardiac tamponade, and should be considered a medical emergency. 00:03:16In addition to chest pain, patients with pulmonary embolus may develop dyspnea, wheezing and a marked decrease in blood pressure. 00:03:24Factors that increase the risk for blood clots in the lower extremities or pelvis, and subsequent embolus include immobilization or recent surgery. 00:  clots in the lower extremities or pelvis, and subsequent embolus include immobilization or recent surgery. 00:03:33Two patient types that therapists frequently treat, patients who've had recent surgery or been immobilized. 00:03:41Pulmonary embolism also has a high mortality rate, so if the physical therapist suspects this condition, the patient should immediately be referred to emergency care. 00:03:51Pleurisy is an irritation of the pleural membranes that make up the lining between the lungs and the inner surface of the rib cage. 00:03:59The pain that pleurisy produces is characteristically described as sharp and stabbing, and the pain is worsened by deep inspiration and other ribcage movements such as cough, bending, and reaching activities. 00:04:14Thoracic pain, gastrointestinal disorders, gastric or peptic ulcers are common disorders that may cause thoracic pain. 00:04:23G , gastric or peptic ulcers are common disorders that may cause thoracic pain. 00:04:23Gastric ulcers outside of the duodenum may be associated with malignancy. 00:04:28Symptoms may include black, tarry stools, red clumps and vomit, changes in pain with eating, or pain in the chest or back. 00:04:36Cholecystitis is an inflammation of the gall bladder, and may cause pain in the right upper abdomen, interscapular or right scapular region. 00:04:46Duodenal ulcers manifests as dull nine or burning pain in the epigastric region, in the mid thoracic region, or in the supraclavicular region. 00:04:56These symptoms occur when the stomach is empty, and are relieved with eating or taking antacids. 00:05:02Relief is temporary, however, and ,

gastric ulcer, eating may increase rather than relieve the symptoms. 00:05:15With regards to cholecystitis, patients initially may present to therapy with shoulder or mid back pain. 00:05:21But suspicion of this condition should result in immediate referral to their physician. 00:05:25[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:28Kidney disorders, pyelonephritis and renal stones may cause pain in the posterior thoracic and lumbar region. 00:05:36Often accompanied by chills, fever, nausea, vomiting and renal colic. 00:05:41Pyelonephritis is a kidney infection, and kidney stones are hard salt precipitates ic.

underlying conditions which may be responsible for craniofacial pain. 00:00:32Describe at least two symptoms associated with meningitis and subarachnoid hemorrhage. 00:00:39Identify three items from a patient's history that may increase the likelihood of a brain tumor as a source of craniofacial pain. 00:00:48Central cord syndromes, ligamentous instability, brachial plexus neuropathies, and Pancoast Central cord syndromes, ligamentous instability, brachial plexus neuropathies, and Pancoast's tumor may be responsible for shoulder and or cervical pain. 00:00:59Special tests for cervical instability have a high likelihood of bias and questionable diagnostic accuracy. 00:01:05Before performing any of these tests, utilize the Canadian C-Spine rules. 00:01:11Tingling, weakness, numbness,

00:00:10[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:13So our objectives for this section are to identify 3 factors which may increase, change the pen color here, susceptibility to more serious elbow, wrist, and hand injuries. 00:00:27Summarize Grade I, Grade II, and Grade III soft tissue injuries. 00:00:31Describe 4 factors which may raise suspicion of an infection in a patient's hand. 00:00:37Summarize important components of an examination of the upper extremity for infection, including 4 specific factors, the presence of which are associated with most major hand infections. 00:00:51Describe Raynaud's

or decrease the likelihood of this diagnosis. 00:01:01Define complex regional pain syndrome and symptoms, which if present, may increase the likelihood of CRPS contributing to the patient's condition. 00:01:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:15Elbow, wrist, and hand pain. 00:01:17Tauma-related injuries to the elbow, wrist, or hand should raise suspicion of serious injury. 00:01:24Osteoporosis, history of corticosteroid use, or a history of immunosuppression may all increase susceptibility to a more serious injury. 00:01:36Fractures of the elbow, wrist, and hand. 00:01:39An elbow fracture is likely after a fall onto ractures of the elbow, wrist, and hand. 00:01:39An elbow fracture is likely after a fall onto an outstretched hand or after direct trauma to the elbow. 00:01:46Other common fractures include a distal radius fracture, scaphoid fracture, lunate, or capitate fractures. 00:01:53In an elbow fracture, elbow extension is the function most impaired, and there may be a palpable gap between the olecranon and the trochlear notch of the humerus. 00:02:04A fall also may cause anterolateral pain and tenderness, with an inability to supinate and pronate the forearm. 00:02:11Often the arm will be held against the trunk with the elbow flexed, with the patient demonstrating an inability to fully extend the elbow. 00:02:21In a distal radius fracture, known as a Colles fracture, this typically manifests with local pain. 00: :21In a distal radius fracture, known as a Colles fracture, this typically manifests with local pain. 00:02:27Distal radius tenderness, swelling, and ecchymosis, and wrist extension in particular is very painful. 00:02:35After a scaphoid fracture, the patient has similar signs and symptoms, but these are localized to the anatomic snuff box. 00:02:43The wrist can also be very stiff, secondary to the swelling. 00:02:45In a lunate or capitate fracture, the lunate fractures are rare and often are related to osteonecrosis while a capitate fracture is more common. 00:02:58Patients present with symptoms similar to those of wrist pain, swelling, and tenderness at the mid-dorsal wrist area. 1.5 The Elbow, Wrist, and Hand Pain; Regional Pain Patterns and Associated

so by the end of this lecture, you should be able to identify which red flags are not uncommon to encounter in patients with low back pain and describe why. 00:00:31Identify the 9 conditions in the Do Not Want to Miss list of pathologies which are life threatening and may mimic other common disorders. 00:00:39And describe why it's important for patients to complete an intake questionnaire. 00:00:43[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:48Do not want to miss. 00:00:49Keep in mind that these are more common in adults, in the elderly, and in patients presenting to outpatient settings. 00:00  in mind that these are more common in adults, in the elderly, and in patients presenting to outpatient settings. 00:00:56Beware of unremitting pain that's not made better or worse by anything, including changing positions. 00:01:03So the nine conditions highlighted in this chapter from your textbook are more common in adults, especially in older older adults and those adults seen in ambulatory settings. 00:01:13So what this means is that for PTs working with children or working in an inpatient setting, this list of nine conditions would probably include some different conditions. 10.2 Conditions 1 and 200:00:02So lecture ten to Conditions 1&2, Major Depressive Disorder and Suicidal Risk. 00:00:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:12You should be able to describe the prevalence of major depressive disorder in adults. 00:00:16Identify 2 questions that can help you decide whether to refer a patient  major depressive disorder in adults. 00:00:16Identify 2 questions that can help you decide whether to refer a patient for consult. 00:00:22Identify a patient questionnaire helpful when screening patients for major depressive disorder. 00:00:27Discuss which patient groups historically are at higher risk of committing suicide. 00:00:32And identify factors associated with increased suicide risk and what questions might elucidate this information 00:00:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:42Major depressive disorder. 00:00:44The prevalence is as high as 13% for adults. 00:00:48Half of those will experience remission, but half of these will relapse the following year. 00:00:54Refer to your Boissonnault book Box 20.2 for important risk factors. 00:01:00A 2-question initial screening is recommended, so box 20.2 in your text provides a list of risk factors related to major depressive disorder question initial screening is recommended, so box 20.2 in your text provides a list of risk factors related to major depressive disorder. 10.3 Conditions 3, 4, 500:00:02Lecture 10.3, conditions three, four and five, femoral head and neck fracture, cauda equina syndrome, and cervical myelopathy. 00:00:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:16Objectives, by the end of this lecture, you should be able to identify risk factors for femoral head and neck fractures. 00:00:23You should describe how femoral head and neck fractures may present in the clinic. 00:00:28You should be able to describe two physical examination tests, which may be useful for identifying femoral head and neck fractures. 00:00:36You should define Cauda Equina Syndrome and describe how a patient with this pathology may present clinically. 00:00:43You should be able a Equina Syndrome and describe how a patient with this pathology may present clinically. 00:00:43You should be able to identify red flags, specific to Cauda equina syndrome. 00:00:47You should be able to define cervical myelopathy and describe how a patient with this pathology may present clinically. 00:00:55You should be able to identify the three components of diagnosing cervical myelopathy and identify four disorders which may present like cervical myelopathy. 00:01:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:07Femoral head and neck fractures. 00:01:10So femoral head and neck fractures lead to increased morbidity, mortality, and Healthcare issues. 00:01:19Risk factors include, osteoporosis and falls, low socioeconomic status cardiovascular disease, Endocrine disorders, certain medications, and a low BMI. 00:01:31Fall prevention and treatment of osteoporosis are paramount , certain medications, and a low BMI. 00:01:31Fall prevention and treatment of osteoporosis are paramount. 00:01:35The relevance of femoral head and neck fractures, is that once the injury occurs there is significant morbidity, mortality, and health care issues. 00:01:44Referral for diagnostic imaging can prevent a non-displaced fracture from progressing to a displaced fracture, which, if it occurs, then typically requires surgical intervention. 00:01:55It's estimated that approximately 30-60% of community-dwelling older adults fall each year. 00:02:02Approximately 90% of hip fractures in older patients occur from a simple fall from the standing position. 00:02:08Women sustain hip fractures more often due to their higher rates of osteoporosis. 00:02:13The lifetime risk of hip fracture is 17.5% for women and 6% for men. 00:02:20On The lifetime risk of hip fracture is 17.5% for women and 6% for men. 00:02:20On average, women who sustain a femoral neck fracture are 77 years old and men are 72 years old. 00:02:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:33Screening for femoral head and neck fractures. 00:02:36So pain and local tenderness may be associated with the femoral head and neck fracture, particularly in the groin, trochanteric and/or buttock regions. 00:02:44There may be at the presence of deformity including a shortened limb, edema, ecchymosis, loss of function and mobility, including weight bearing. 10.4 Conditions 6 and 700:00:01This is lecture 10.4, conditions 6 and 7 for the nine conditions we don't want to miss. 00:00:07And those 6 and 7 include abdominal aortic aneurys  we don't want to miss. 00:00:07And those 6 and 7 include abdominal aortic aneurysm and deep vein thrombosis. 00:00:13[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:18After this lecture you should be able to define abdominal aortic aneurysm and describe risk factors associated with it. 00:00:25You should be able to describe how a patient suffering from an abdominal aortic aneurysm may present clinically. 00:00:32You should be able to describe how to screen a patient you suspect is suffering from abdominal aortic aneurysm, including palpation. 00:00:40You should be able to define deep vein thrombosis and describe risk factors associated with DVT. 00:00:45And define wells and modified wells score and how to screen a patient you suspect may have a DVT. 00:00:51[BLANK_  wells score and how to screen a patient you suspect may have a DVT. 00:00:51[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:58Abdominal aortic aneurysm. 00:01:00An aneurysm is a bulge or ballooning, and in the case of abdominal aortic aneurysm, it's a bulge or ballooning of the abdominal aortic artery. 00:01:10Surgery carries a 4.2% risk of mortality and a 32% complication rate. 00:01:15The abdominal aortic aneurysm, or AAA, usually occurs in individuals age 60 and older.  2.1 Etiology of Joint PainEffects00:00:00[MUSIC] 00:00:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:11All

objectives for this section are to describe why identifying patterns and non joint related limb pain is critical for diagnosis. 00:00:18Identify components critical to examining a patient complaining of dizziness. 00:00:23Differentiate between central and peripheral causes of dizziness. 00:00:28Define disequilibrium including contributing factors. 00:00:32Describe symptoms, examination components, and potential causes of presyncope. 00:00:38Describe symptoms and examples of nonspecific dizziness. 00:00:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:45Physical examination. 00:00:48Comprehensive physical :42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:45Physical examination. 00:00:48Comprehensive physical examination and observation can detect symptoms such as joint redness or swelling, potentially indicating a need for urgent physician referral. 00:00:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:00A thorough physical examination comprising system reviews and keen observation can underscore concerns raised during a patient history gathering. 00:01:10Symptoms such as joint redness, warmth, and edema, particularly in the absence of major trauma, may necessitate urgent physician referral. 00:01:18[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:21Physical examination, limb pain. 00:01:24Recognition to patterns and non-joint related limb pain is critical. 00:01:29Etiology of limb pain, conditions such as hypothyroidism and Lyme disease, among others, cause limb pain and share symptoms with treatable conditions.  conditions such as hypothyroidism and Lyme disease, among others, cause limb pain and share symptoms with treatable conditions. 00:01:39This necessitates in depth review of symptoms to ensure accurate diagnosis. 00:01:45Hypothyroidism, Lyme disease, polymyalgia rheumatica, statin-induced myopathy all share these traits. 00:01:53They're all systemic in nature. 00:01:55They all generate musculoskeletal symptoms. 00:01:57And they all generate non-specific symptoms. 00:02:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:03Bilateral lower limb complaints could indicate central or systemic issues, while shifting limb pain without a mechanical cause may suggest conditions not typically managed by physical therapists. 00:02:15In which case the findings combined with their non

lecture include describe the etiology of cervicogenic, migraines, tension, cluster headaches, and giant cell arteritis. 00:00:16Describe typical symptoms of a migraine headache. 00:00:20Headaches are very common with a lifetime prevalence of over 90% in both men and women. 00:00:24I'm sure most of you have experienced a headache. 00:00:28There are frequent comorbidity seen in outpatient physical therapy and occupational therapy clinics, etiology of headaches, cervicogenic migraines, and cluster. 00:00:38Cervicogenic headaches arise from neck tissues like facettes and muscles causing unilateral head pain starting in the neck. 00:00:45Migraines are often unilateral but they can shift from  unilateral head pain starting in the neck. 00:00:45Migraines are often unilateral but they can shift from side to side between attacks. 00:00:51Tension headaches are bilateral and often described as a vise like band. 00:00:55Cluster headaches come in severe unilateral pain clusters and they can last 15 minutes to three hours with autonomic features like tearing and congestion. 00:01:06Provocation with neck movements helps diagnose cervicogenic headache. 00:01:11Migraines may be associated with nausea. 00:01:14Sensitivity to light or sound and throbbing pain that prevents formal activity. 00:01:19Tension headaches may be associated with life stressors and are usually milder than migraines. 00:01:25Continuing with etiology of headaches including arteritis migraines and continued tension headache discussion. 00:01:32Giant cell arteritis causes new onset of temporal headache  migraines and continued tension headache discussion. 00:01:32Giant cell arteritis causes new onset of temporal headache and jaw or neck pain. 00:01:37It can result in vision changes, fever, and even weight loss may occur. 00:01:43Migraines may present with or without aura, and may be preceded up to 48 hours by symptoms such as fatigue, altered mood, or changes in appetite. 00:01:52They also can include prodromal symptoms. 00:01:56Tension headaches lack the associated symptoms of migraines. 00:02:00Giant cell arteritis is a vasculitis, eventually resulting in artery luminal occlusion. 00:02:07The resultant vascular stenosis can cause permanent visual loss if the cranial arteries are involved and the inflammation can lead to aortic dissection. 00:02:17Blood vessels typically involved include the medium and large vessels originating from the a  aortic dissection. 00:02:17Blood vessels typically involved include the medium and large vessels originating from the aortic arch. 00:02:23The inflammation is likely to be segmental, skipping portions of the vessel. 00:02:29The chief complaint will be a new onset of unilateral headache, often described as new or unfamiliar to the patient. 2.3 Physical Examination Headache00:00:00Okay, welcome back to week 2, lecture number 3, physical examination, headache. 00:00:06Objectives for this lecture include describe

the first lecture, Principles of Radiology. 00:00:16And in this lecture we'll be discussing general principles and radiology. 00:00:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:27So the objectives here are to describe why clinicians need to view diagnostic images. 00:00:34Describe radiology and musculoskeletal imaging. 00:00:37And then summarize the evolution of imaging From Wilhelm Rontgen in 1895 through today, so a lot of this first lecture is going to include some history. 00:00:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:54So why do we need diagnostic imaging? 00:00:59Well, the PT education provides a foundation for understanding imaging and the PT education provides a foundation for ? 00:00:59Well, the PT education provides a foundation for understanding imaging and the PT education provides a foundation for being able to associate our clinical findings with findings on imaging. 00:01:15[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:17So if physicians already have access to ordering and interpreting imaging, then why would physical therapists need any kind of diagnostic imaging education? 3.1 Principles of RadiologyEffects00:00:00[MUSIC] 00:00:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:09So this is the first lecture, Principles of Radiology. 00:00:16And in

00:00:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:09The objectives for this lecture are to identify the three things required to produce an X-ray. 00:00:15And number two, describe the terms radiograph, image receptor, radiation, effective dose limits, and sievert. 00:00:27So a radiograph is an X-ray film containing an image of part of a patient's anatomy. 00:00:34And producing a radiograph requires an X-ray source, a patient, and an X-ray film or an image receptor. 00:00:44So it's also referred to as plain film radiograph, standard radiograph, conventional radiograph, and most commonly now as films or X-rays. 00:00:55The standard medical literature language is radiographs. 00:01:00Also, it -rays. 00:00:55The standard medical literature language is radiographs. 00:01:00Also, it's important to remember that hardcopy is film and softcopy is a digital copy of the image. 00:01:11This slide on the right side over here shows a picture of radiant energy in the electromagnetic spectrum from lower frequency radio waves all the way up through higher frequency Gamma waves. 00:01:26And radiology is the branch of medicine concerned with radiant energy and radioactive substances. 00:01:33And those include X-rays and radioactive isotopes along with ionizing radiation. 00:01:40And this also encompasses the application of this information to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases. 00:01:50Radiation is energy transmitted through space or matter. 00:01:54And the shorter the wavelength, the higher the energy of the radiation and the greater the penetrating power. 00:02:01Physicians specializing in radiology  ionizing radiation can be helpful, for example combating diseases such as cancer. 00:04:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:53There are no prescribed limits on radiation doses to patients. 00:04:57This means that no amount of radiation is considered too much for a patient when the procedure is justified by the health care provider after considering the benefits and the risks.   the higher the energy of the radiation and the greater the penetrating power. 00:02:01Physicians specializing in radiology are radiologists, and professional technicians who produce the images are radiographers. 00:02:12Most imaging studies are produced by ionizing radiation, while diagnostic ultrasound and MRI are examples of non-ionizing imaging studies. 00:02:23So diagnostic imaging is the same thing as medical imaging and the same thing as radiology, they're basically interchangeable descriptions. 00:02:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:36What are X-rays? 00:02:38X-rays are ionizing electromagnetic radiation. 00:02:42And this is different than non-ionizing radiation like ultraviolet light, visible light, infrared, microwave, radio and TV radiation. 00:02:51That does not have enough energy to remove electrons from atoms or molecules. 00:02:56X-rays are ionizing electromagnetic radiation.  have enough energy to remove electrons from atoms or molecules. 00:02:56X-rays are ionizing electromagnetic radiation. 00:03:01So again, some non-ionizing sources of electromagnetic fields include cell phones, tablets, radios, older TVs, power lines, electrical wiring, and home appliances. 00:03:14And if we look at this picture here, we can see basically this span moving from non-ionizing radiation on the left, ionizing radiation on the right. 00:03:28And ionizing radiation means that this radiation is going to have the potential to remove electrons from atoms or molecules. 00:03:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:46So non-ionizing radiation is low energy radiation that can cause molecules to vibrate and produce heat like microwave, ovens. 00:03:55Radio waves and visible light are other examples, and for most people, non-ionizing radiation does not pose a risk 55Radio waves and visible light are other examples, and for most people, non-ionizing radiation does not pose a risk to their health. 00:04:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:12The sievert or millisievert is a measure to quantify radiation and measure its impact on people. 00:04:20In high doses, Ionizing radiation can damage cells or organs or even cause death by detaching electrons from atoms or molecules. 00:04:30Which involves the production of ions, and hence the term ionizing radiation. 00:04:34Inappropriate doses used in medical diagnosis and treatment of diseases, ionizing radiation can be

XRAYS00:00:02Welcome to lecture 3.3, and this lecture is The Production of X-Rays. 00:00:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:14The objectives of this lecture are to describe how x-rays are produced. 00:00:19Describe radio density and how it is depicted in a radiograph, describe the effect of thickness and orientation on a radiograph, and identify four factors that impact image quality. 00:00:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:36How are x-rays produced? 00:00:38So to produce x-rays we have to have a source of electrons, and then we have to have a force to move them. 00:00:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:50And finally you have to have something to stop the movement of those electrons quickly, and so that leads us right into :50And finally you have to have something to stop the movement of those electrons quickly, and so that leads us right into our next slide. 00:01:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:04So, we have an x-ray tube over here and we have the x-rays traveling here and we have the image receptor right here. 00:01:17The x-rays are produced in the tube and they travel out and pass through the patient. 00:01:24Where they're attenuated to different degrees depending on the tissue that those electrons pass through. 00:01:31The x-ray beam that emerges from the other side of the patient called the remnant radiation is intercepted by an image receptor. 00:01:40The information that the receptor is processed by different methods depending on the type of receptor and following that an image is produced, which is called a radiograph. 00:01:50[BLANK_AUDIO]  that an image is produced, which is called a radiograph. 00:01:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:56Understanding the Image, radio density is determined by the composition and thickness of an object. 00:02:03And radio density affects the amount of radiation an object absorbs from the X ray. 00:02:12Radioopaque means that an object is not easily penetrated by x-rays. 00:02:19The representation of the object is white because x-rays do not reach the receptor. 00:02:24Examples include things like heavy metals or fillings and teeth, or contrast media such as barium sulfate. 00:02:33Radiolucent material is easily penetrated by x-rays. 00:02:37Most of the x-rays will reach the receptors so the radio graphic representation of the object is dark, air is an example. 00:02:46When describing bone, radio loosen areas have  representation of the object is dark, air is an example. 00:02:46When describing bone, radio loosen areas have decreased radio density due to abnormal processes such as osteoporotic bone or osteolytic tumors or infections. 00:03:00And in this image on the top right here we can see that objects that are more radiolucent are near the top such as air. 00:03:11And objects that are more radio-dense are near the bottom, such as metal. 3.3 Production of XRAYS00:00:02Welcome to lecture 3.3, and this lecture is The Production of X-Rays. 00:00:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:14The objectives of this lecture are to describe

welcome to lecture 3.4. 00:00:04This is an introduction to practice acts and deciding whether or not to image. 00:00:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:11So our objectives here are to describe state practice regulation, with specific regard to how the scope of practice is regulated both geographically and legislatively. 00:00:22Provide two reasons why a physical therapist might request imaging. 00:00:27Define the American College of Rheumatology, the ACR, Appropriateness Criteria. 00:00:33And describe how the x-rays interact with the patient, and the advantages and disadvantages of x-ray film versus digital imaging technologies. 00:00:43[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:46Referring patients for imaging. 00:00:49So the legal scope of practice AUDIO] 00:00:46Referring patients for imaging. 00:00:49So the legal scope of practice in terms of referring patients is regulated by each United States jurisdiction through PT practice acts. 00:01:00And I have links on here to the APTA federal special interest group and the Academy of Orthopedic Physical Therapy special interest group for imaging. 00:01:11In Australia, the United Kingdom, a portion of Canadian provinces and Norway, physical therapists have imaging referral privileges and imaging is standard within physical therapy practice. 00:01:26Colorado, Utah, Wisconsin, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Washington DC, New Jersey, Maryland and Arizona are states that expressly allow physical therapy imaging referral. 00:01:41There are a growing number of areas of the United States that are gaining referral privileges. 00:01:47Practice acts approach referral for imaging privileges with language that's categorized as specifically inclusive, interpretable to allow referral, silent, or ice acts approach referral for imaging privileges with language that's categorized as specifically inclusive, interpretable to allow referral, silent, or specifically exclusive. 00:02:02Wisconsin and Utah, for example, allow PTs to refer for imaging. 00:02:07Colorado, Maryland, and Washington DC have some degree of freedom to refer for imaging and interpretations of their practice x. 00:02:15However, practice x of other disciplines, radiology technicians, for example, may limit who the provider can take orders from 00:02:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:28So what that means is that for radiology technicians, the practice act for that discipline may be prescriptive or prohibitive related to whom they can take their orders from. 00:02:40Thus, potentially affecting physical therapist's ability to refer for imaging. 00:02:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:49So why would we refer for imaging in  00:02:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:49So why would we refer for imaging in the first place? 00:02:53Well, first to obtain a more comprehensive evaluation, to see the processes of growth or development or healing, disease or dysfunction. 00:03:02We can integrate imaging with the patient history and other lab or medical data, along with the physical examination, to provide a more complete set of information to base patient care decisions on. 3.4 Practice Acts and Deciding Whether to Image00:00:01Hi, and welcome to lecture 3.4. 00:00:04This is an introduction to

reasons why a physical therapist might request imaging. 00:00:27Define the American College of Rheumatology, the ACR, Appropriateness Criteria. 00:00:33And describe how the x-rays interact with the patient, and the advantages and disadvantages of x-ray film versus digital imaging technologies. 00:00:43[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:46Referring patients for imaging. 00:00:49So the legal scope of practice in terms of referring patients is regulated by each United States jurisdiction through PT practice acts. 00:01:00And I have links on here to the APTA federal special interest group and the Academy of Orthopedic Physical Therapy special interest group for imaging. 00:01:11In Australia, the United Kingdom, a portion of Canadian provinces and Norway, physical therapists have imaging . 00:01:11In Australia, the United Kingdom, a portion of Canadian provinces and Norway, physical therapists have imaging referral privileges and imaging is standard within physical therapy practice. 00:01:26Colorado, Utah, Wisconsin, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Washington DC, New Jersey, Maryland and Arizona are states that expressly allow physical therapy imaging referral. 00:01:41There are a growing number of areas of the United States that are gaining referral privileges. 00:01:47Practice acts approach referral for imaging privileges with language that's categorized as specifically inclusive, interpretable to allow referral, silent, or specifically exclusive. 00:02:02Wisconsin and Utah, for example, allow PTs to refer for imaging. 00:02:07Colorado, Maryland, and Washington DC have some degree of freedom to refer for imaging and interpretations of their practice x. 00:02:15However, practice x of other disciplines, radiology technicians, for example, may limit who the . 00:02:15However, practice x of other disciplines, radiology technicians, for example, may limit who the provider can take orders from 00:02:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:28So what that means is that for radiology technicians, the practice act for that discipline may be prescriptive or prohibitive related to whom they can take their orders from. 00:02:40Thus, potentially affecting physical therapist's ability to refer for imaging. 00:02:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:49So why would we refer for imaging in the first place? 00:02:53Well, first to obtain a more comprehensive evaluation, to see the processes of growth or development or healing, disease or dysfunction. 00:03:02We can integrate imaging with the patient history and other lab or medical data, along with the physical examination, to provide a more complete set of information to base patient care decisions on.  or medical data, along with the physical examination, to provide a more complete set of information to base patient care decisions on.  3.5 Prescribing ImagingEffects00:00:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:02Hi, so welcome to lecture 3.5 on prescribing imaging. 00:00:10So in this lecture, we'll identify three considerations when deciding whether to refer a patient for imaging. 00:00:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:20We'll describe the appropriate imaging components of a request for imaging. 00:00:26We'll identify three negative consequences of imaging. 00:00:29And finally, we'll discuss how imaging results should be interpreted and communicated. 00:00:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:36So when we're referring the patient for imaging, a few things that we need to ask are, do we need additional information to help make a diagnosis, or a more comprehensive evaluation? 00:00:50And then, how severe do you believe the underlying condition could be?  or a more comprehensive evaluation? 00:00:50And then, how severe do you believe the underlying condition could be? 00:00:56And finally, what's the urgency of the referral, right? 00:00:58Do you believe that there's a potential for the underlying condition to become incredibly severe over the next 24 hours? 00:01:05Or do you think it's something that the patient might be able to wait to go see their physician until the next day? 00:01:13So essentially, imaging can provide additional information, really, a more comprehensive evaluation. 00:01:20And that really means that the success of rehabilitation depends on the effectiveness of your evaluation. 00:01:26And so the more thorough your evaluation, some more information you have on which to build your rehab program. 00:01:33So, many of your tools, the observation, the palpation, manual muscle testing, physical performance testing, etc, those are , many of your tools, the observation, the palpation, manual muscle testing, physical performance testing, etc, those are dependent on your own perceptive skills. 00:01:46And those have some degree of subjectivity and bias and limitation. 00:01:52And imaging can provide an objective visual aspect to the evaluation that makes the expertise of the clinician a little more comprehensive. 00:02:03So supplementing your evaluation and your re-evaluation with images can increase your awareness of the patient in a different dimension. 00:02:14So your knowledge of functional anatomy essentially becomes more dynamically effective because you're able to directly visualize the processes of bone growth and healing, disease and dysfunction, related to findings that are seen on imaging. 00:02:34So the information that you seek is often of a different nature from the information that a physician seeks, and a different nature than what might be described in the radiologist report. 00:02:47So  a physician seeks, and a different nature than what might be described in the radiologist report. 00:02:47So, for example, a physician needs to know whether a fracture of the distal radius that has united with a malunion deformity is clinically stable. 00:02:56And if so, then the cast can be removed and the patient can be sent for rehab. 00:03:01On the other hand, you also need to know the severity and the configuration of the malunion deformity. 3.5 Prescribing ImagingEffects00:00:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:02Hi, so welcome to lecture 3.5 on prescribing imaging. 00:00:10So in this lecture, we'll identify three considerations when deciding whether to refer a

musculoskeletal imaging studies, that there are lots of clients with this particular lecture will include. 00:00:24Arthrography, myelography, conventional tomography, computed tomography, nuclear imaging, bone scintigraphy, magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, and ultrasonography. 00:00:42And then we'll also describe the functional view imaging. 00:00:47So, lots of stuff here. 00:00:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:52So other common musculoskeletal imaging studies, contrast enhanced radiographs or arthrography. 00:00:59So that's where we inject, a contrast substance, into a  or arthrography. 00:00:59So that's where we inject, a contrast substance, into a joint and the injected material distends the joint capsule and the internal tissues. 00:01:13So the synovium and the ligaments and the articular cartilage and the joint capsule abnormalities can all be imaged using this technique. 00:01:23So if we look at the top image here A, that's a negative contrast study of the knee. 00:01:32And you can note the full extent of the capsule here, as it's distended by the contrast, that's what these little white dashes are, right? 00:01:42You can imagine that that thing kind of filling up with that fluid, and then down to here at B, this is a shoulder arthrogram. 00:01:51And so after injection of contrast into the glenohumeral joint. 00:01:56There's 01:51And so after injection of contrast into the glenohumeral joint. 00:01:56There's a filling of the sub acromial and sub deltoid bursa complex here indicating a rotator cuff tear. 00:02:06Then down and see this bottom image this is a corneal CT arthrogram of the wrist and it demonstrates leak of contrast with a radiocarpal joint through a tear and the scapula lunate ligament. 00:02:19So here we see the contrast right there. 00:02:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:25| And so this is a finding that you wouldn't be able to see on just an X-ray of the wrist. 00:02:30And so that's why these Contrast enhanced radiographs are [UNKNOWN] arthography can be extremely useful. 00:02:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02 KNOWN] arthography can be extremely useful. 00:02:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:44So other common musculoskeletal imaging studies include myelography, and that's contrast enhanced radiographs. 00:02:55Of the spinal cord, the nerve root, or the dura mater. 00:03:01And, so if we look at these images here this is A, and this is B here. 00:03:06A and B are anterior posterior and lateral views made after injection of contrast into the fecal sac. 00:03:14And this conventional biogram can identify where the flow of contrast is restricted, but it can't identify the reason for the restriction, right? 3.6 Imaging Studies00:00:02Hi, and welcome to this lecture on imaging studies. 00:00:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:10So the

going to talk a little bit more about general principles and radiology. 00:00:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:20So this first section is really dedicated to describing why clinicians need to view diagnostic images. 00:00:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:34Unnecessary examinations and the overutilization of x-rays. 00:00:39And if we look at the quote for number 1, it is easier to order an x-ray than to think. 00:00:45And so we're dealing with an issue and we're trying to avoid overutilization. 00:00:51And overutilization means excessive radiation per unit of diagnostic information or therapeutic impact or health utilization. 00:00:51And overutilization means excessive radiation per unit of diagnostic information or therapeutic impact or health outcome. 00:01:00Essentially trying to limit the amount of radiation per useful bit of knowledge. 00:01:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:09That includes excessive radiation per image, or excessive images per exam, or excessive examinations per patient. 00:01:18We want that number to be as small as possible. 00:01:21Examples might be, how useful is imaging of the skull when you're evaluating a patient for headache, or neck pain, or vertigo, or seizures? 00:01:33A single lateral image would be adequate and would result in about a 75% to 80% reduction in radiation exposure versus other kinds of interventions. 00:01:46Lateral imaging, for example, of the chest and individuals under age 40 may add no new information and could safely be eliminated in the  imaging, for example, of the chest and individuals under age 40 may add no new information and could safely be eliminated in the vast majority of cases. 00:01:56Oblique films of the lumbar spine in children are probably not useful, but they do result in high doses of radiation. 00:02:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:07So if we look at number 3, the lack of knowledge of the limitations of radiology, right, that can also cause overutilization. 00:02:14Essentially, it's the lack of knowledge regarding what radiology can and what radiology cannot do. 00:02:21And then what about number 4, the reliance on radiologic versus clinical findings? 00:02:27So there's the potential for an undue dependence on radiology. 00:02:32Are repeat examinations necessary? 00:02:35And if so, how frequently to follow up on a routine 02:32Are repeat examinations necessary? 00:02:35And if so, how frequently to follow up on a routine fracture healing, for example, especially if the patient's functional changes and symptoms depict their responses to treatment. 00:02:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 4.1 Why View Diagnostic

Examinations and Interpreting ImagesEffects00:00:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:01So welcome to lecture 4.2, and we're going to continue with general principles in radiology. 00:00:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:16Our objectives for this portion are to describe bone remodeling and how it is related to function and then identify. 00:00:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:30Two kinds of errors when interpreting images and then define the ABCS or ABCs of how to begin radiographic analysis. 00:00:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:47So let's continue with radiologic evaluations, search patterns and diagnosis. 00:00:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:57So most of you have probably heard of Wolff's Law and well, this slide discusses the inner architecture of 00:57So most of you have probably heard of Wolff's Law and well, this slide discusses the inner architecture of bones and its importance for bone growth. 00:01:06And this is the original article published by Julius Wolff in 1870. 00:01:13This is where Wolff's Law comes from. 00:01:15[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:23Bone remodels continuously throughout life and that remodeling is directly related to the function. 00:01:30So, if we see here, Wolff's law use it, so you don't lose it. 00:01:37Julius Wolff's law was basically, as a consequence of the primary shape variations in the continuous loading or even due to loading a long bone changes its architecture according to some mathematical rules. 00:01:55And as a secondary effect and governed by those same rules, the bone shape also changes. 00:02:01[BL . 00:09:03And some examples for altered size of bones include gigantism, or has used disease or acromegaly. 00:09:11For extra bone you might see polydactyly, congenital anomalies might include a cervical rib or transitional vertebra at lumbosacral junction. 00:09:23And for the absence of bones, we could think of things like possibly an amputation or congenital abnormality. 00:09:29And then finally for developmental deformities scoliosis or genu valgum are pretty decent examples of that. 00:09:36[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:43So starting on the left, we have Paget's disease here, and that's the random proliferation of osteoblastic and osteoplastic activity. 00:09:53So bone formation and bone resorption that's just random. 00:09:58And it produces these curious fluffy areas as  bone formation and bone resorption that's just random. 00:09:58And it produces these curious fluffy areas as fluffy sclerosis of the enlarged skull. 00:10:04And this elderly man here with acid. 00:10:06So these are the clip areas here. 00:10:11And so the lateral view of the skull gets an appearance of spots of, quote, cotton wool, unquote, that's what it's referred to. 00:10:18And this is a classic radiographic finding during later stages of Paget's disease. 00:10:24In the middle, we have polydactyly in a ten month old child. 00:10:27And what you should note here is the six digit, right? 00:10:29So we have one, two, three, four, five, six. 00:10:35[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:37And finally, on the far  six. 00:10:35[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:37And finally, on the far right over here, we have congenital deformities in an eight-month-old girl, which include bowing of the femurs and bowing of the tibias with an absence of fibulas. 00:10:55There aren't any femurs aren't any fibula is present there are fevers present. 00:11:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:07So continuing with alignment, remember to contour bone, so we're looking at the general contour bone. 00:11:14This includes internal and external irregularities. 00:11:18The cortical outline of each bone osteophytes breaks or gaps in the continuity of the cortex, or markings related to past surgeries. 00:11:29So some examples of internal and external irregularities could be related to disease or trauma or developmental or congenital factors. 11:29So some examples of internal and external irregularities could be related to disease or trauma or developmental or congenital factors. 00:11:39The cortical outline following should be smooth and continuous that we should imagine for example in the long run we should see this. 00:11:49Osteophytes or bony upwards that occur at joint margins that are usually associated with degenerative changes of cartilage. 00:11:58Along with those, a spur is an osteophyte that looks pointy and isolated, and can also form tension at tissue attachment sites. 00:12:08So breaks are gaps and the continuity of the cortex of the bone signify a fracture usually markings related to surgical history can include bone graft donation sites or drill holes for surgical implants such as plates or other fixation devices. 00:12:26Note that alignment architecture and alignment contour aren't mutually exclusive. 00:12:32So for example, the dementia in general deformation in architecture also  contour aren't mutually exclusive. 00:12:32So for example, the dementia in general deformation in architecture also falls under bony contour. 00:12:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:47So continuing with some imaging examples here, we'll start on the left with this osteophyte or heel spur and this is seen as a radio-dense projection at the margin of the anterior inferior surface of the calcaneus. 00:13:02We can see that in the little black circle there. 00:13:06Next in the middle here we have an example of a cortical fracture, seen in a complete fracture of the fifth metacarpal neck at the arrowhead here. 00:13:16This is referred to as a boxer's fracture. 00:13:22Finally, note the odd appearance of old surgical sites corresponding with the arrowheads. 00:13:29And this patient had a fibular fracture and  appearance of old surgical sites corresponding with the arrowheads. 00:13:29And this patient had a fibular fracture and a dislocation which was repaired with a plate running along the shaft of the fibula and compression screws across the tibia to reestablish the stability of the ankle bones. 00:13:42And you can see faint remnants of the drill holes. 00:13:45And there's these radiolucent lines, and you can also see faint lines across the tibia that are radio-dense. 00:13:51So hardware like this is usually not removed until it becomes problematic as a result of infection or loosening. 00:13:57So we can see these white arrows here, and corresponding with those, you can see faint lines right here. 00:14:05We have hardware and also right here we look at this arrow and see this pink line. 00:14:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:  at this arrow and see this pink line. 00:14:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:19Finally, under alignment number three, position of bones relative to other bones. 00:14:23So the alignment of bones relative to other bones, we want to assess for normal positional relationships, looking for fracture or dislocation or subluxation. 00:14:35And a fracture can disrupt a joint articulation, usually it's due to trauma. 00:14:40A dislocation will also disrupt normal articulation, also due to trauma. 00:14:45A subluxation, on the other hand, is a partial dislocation, and that can be related to trauma, but can also be related to degenerative changes that result in changes of the congruence between joint and joint laxity. 00:14:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:15:04So on the far left is a normal shoulder, followed :58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:15:04So on the far left is a normal shoulder, followed by an image of the humerus posteriorly dislocated from the glenoid. 00:15:12And so the glenoid is this area right here, you can see. 00:15:17The humerus sort of obscures the posterior aspect of the glenoid in this picture on the left. 00:15:23However, on the right or in the middle here, you can see the full glenoid because that humerus is dislocated posteriorly. 00:15:32Now on the far right we see an image of a dislocated hip. 00:15:37And it's rare, and in this case it was the result of a road traffic accident and the patient underwent a closed reduction in recovery. 00:15:46And so what we can see here is this is where the femur should  closed reduction in recovery. 00:15:46And so what we can see here is this is where the femur should be, and this is where the femur hits 00:15:53[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your

00:00:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:16Our objectives for this portion are to describe bone remodeling and how it is related to function and then identify. 00:00:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:30Two kinds of errors when interpreting images and then define the ABCS or ABCs of how to begin radiographic analysis. 00:00  of errors when interpreting images and then define the ABCS or ABCs of how to begin radiographic analysis. 00:00:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:47So let's continue with radiologic evaluations, search patterns and diagnosis. 00:00:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:57So most of you have probably heard of Wolff's Law and well, this slide discusses the inner architecture of bones and its importance for bone growth. 00:01:06And this is the original article published by Julius Wolff in 1870. 00:01:13This is where Wolff's Law comes from. 00:01:15[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:23Bone remodels continuously throughout life and that remodeling is directly related to the function. 00:01:30So, if we see here, Wolff's law use it, so you don't lose it. 00:01:37Jul And as a secondary effect and governed by those same rules, the bone shape also changes. 00:02:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:05And so we see here on this side, what this is illustrating is really the inner architecture of the bone here. 00:02:12And we can see these very dense areas here and less dense areas here. 00:02:18And the theory here, according to Julius Wolff, is that that architecture or that density shape change based on the kinds of loading that the bone is exposed to over time. 00:02:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:35So the direction and pattern of loading influences the pattern of the trabecular framework. 00:02:43And this is a drawing of forces and trajectories of forces affecting bone and the force distribution. 00:02:50And so on the left here this is supposed to be a curved beam and on the right  if we see here, Wolff's law use it, so you don't lose it. 00:01:37Julius Wolff's law was basically, as a consequence of the primary shape variations in the continuous loading or even due to loading a long bone changes its architecture according to some mathematical rules. 00:01:55And as a secondary effect and governed by those same rules, the bone shape also changes. 00:02:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:05And so we see here on this side, what this is illustrating is really the inner architecture of the bone here. 00:02:12And we can see these very dense areas here and less dense areas here. 00:02:18And the theory here, according to Julius Wolff, is that that architecture or that density shape change based on the kinds of loading that the bone is exposed to over time. 00:02:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02  loading that the bone is exposed to over time. 00:02:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:35So the direction and pattern of loading influences the pattern of the trabecular framework. 00:02:43And this is a drawing of forces and trajectories of forces affecting bone and the force distribution. 00:02:50And so on the left here this is supposed to be a curved beam and on the right here is a femur. 00:02:59And the drawings represent the forces that the beam is exposed to and the forces that the femur is exposed to. 00:03:07And we can see the trabecular patterns and the stress trajectories of this this beam and how they're kind of similar, right? 00:03:14And so that's sort of the inside. 00:03:15[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:18So the architecture of the human femur and :03:15[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:18So the architecture of the human femur and it was compared with these sort of mathematically constructed stress trajectories on this beam. 00:03:29And that was to show how a human femur can be loaded in a single leg stance was sort of idealized. 00:03:37But the structure was called Coleman's Crane. 00:03:41And the takeaway here was really that besides the basic static relationships, the arrangement of the cross section, the inside of the bone and this beam. 00:03:55And the mechanical influences of the muscle tension, and the ligament tension, and the loading, those all influence the shape and the inner structure. 00:04:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:12And this was important because Wolf was basically convinced that the similarities between those stress trajectories in the brain on the left and the trabecular patterns  Wolf was basically convinced that the similarities between those stress trajectories in the brain on the left and the trabecular patterns and human femur were coincidental. 00:04:27And so he hypothesized that the direction and the pattern of loading influences or controls the pattern of the trabecular framework in the bone, so that's sort of the origin of Wolf's emphasis on mathematical laws. 00:04:41In other words, that there's a direct mathematical relationship between the form or the shape of bone and the load that's imparted on that bone over time. 00:04:54[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:57So, remember that bone remodels continuously throughout life, and that the remodeling of bone is directly related to the function of the bone. 00:05:06And when we look at this slide up at the top, the first thing you'll see here is this ACL tear. 00:05:12And this is  up at the top, the first thing you'll see here is this ACL tear. 00:05:12And this is illustrating, for example, an A on the left, this is a bone that's been exposed to an ACL tear right here. 00:05:25And on the right, this is a bone that has not been exposed to an ACL tear. 00:05:30And so we see variations in bone shape that are associated with the abnormal kinematics, right, so the joints move differently after an ACL reconstruction. 00:05:40So we can look at the shape here, right here, of the medial femoral condyle, how it's sort of an oval. 00:05:48And then on the non-ACL tear we can see the medial femoral condyle is more of a circular shape. 00:05:54On the left over here we can see the medial tibial slope here is pretty straight across and on the 05:54On the left over here we can see the medial tibial slope here is pretty straight across and on the right and the normal you can see that there's actually sort of a slope on the medial tibia. 00:06:13And in B, what we're looking at here is coxa valga, so an increased angle between the head and neck of the femur. 00:06:23And the point of showing you this was to illustrate how the stress changes based on the angle of the neck of the femur. 00:06:31And so the darker are higher values of stress. 00:06:38And then finally you can see over here we're looking at bone remodeling in a person with osteoarthritis with some bone marrow edema and knee pain. 00:06:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:59So, when viewing images, there are two kinds of errors when interpreting an image. 00 IO] 00:06:59So, when viewing images, there are two kinds of errors when interpreting an image. 00:07:04One is an error of observation due to an incomplete or a faulty search pattern. 00:07:10Two are errors of interpretation, and that's the health care provider's failure to link the findings from the imaging to meaningful clinical data. 00:07:22Both of these can be reduced when the referring provider, for example a physical therapist offers their expertise from their specialty. 00:07:30To collaborate with the radiologists to improve the quantity and the quality of information that in turn increases the likelihood of a positive patient outcome. 00:07:40So in a nutshell, what I'd like to sort of convey with this slide is the more and the higher the quality of the information you can provide to the individual who is going to be taking the images and interpreting the images, the more likely you are to get some useful information from that  who is going to be taking the images and interpreting the images, the more likely you are to get some useful information from that imaging, and the more likely you are to help the patient. 00:08:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:09So ABCS, the ABCs, how to search through radiologic imaging. 00:08:15And we have alignment, bone density, cartilage spaces, and soft tissues, these are the four things that we look at. 00:08:24And ABCS is the search pattern for radiologic image interpretation. 00:08:29And note that there are three components for each A, B and C, and there are five components for the S, the soft tissues. 00:08:37You can also see table 2-1 in your McKinnis text for more information 00:08:43[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:08:45So we'll begin with alignment and alignment  00:08:43[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:08:45So we'll begin with alignment and alignment we're looking at skeletal architecture first. 00:08:51So skeletal architecture we're looking at changes in the size of bones or extra bones, congenital anomalies, the absence of bones or developmental deformities. 00:09:03And some examples for altered size of bones include gigantism, or has used disease or acromegaly. 00:09:11For extra bone you might see polydactyly, congenital anomalies might include a cervical rib or transitional vertebra at lumbosacral junction. 00:09:23And for the absence of bones, we could think of things like possibly an amputation or congenital abnormality. 00:09:29And then finally for developmental deformities scoliosis or genu valgum are pretty decent examples of that. 00:09:36[BLANK_AUDIO iosis or genu valgum are pretty decent examples of that. 00:09:36[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:43So starting on the left, we have Paget's disease here, and that's the random proliferation of osteoblastic and osteoplastic activity. 00:09:53So bone formation and bone resorption that's just random. 00:09:58And it produces these curious fluffy areas as fluffy sclerosis of the enlarged skull. 00:10:04And this elderly man here with acid. 00:10:06So these are the clip areas here. 00:10:11And so the lateral view of the skull gets an appearance of spots of, quote, cotton wool, unquote, that's what it's referred to. 00:10:18And this is a classic radiographic finding during later stages of Paget's disease. 00:10:24In the middle, we have polydactyly in  distribution. 00:02:50And so on the left here this is supposed to be a curved beam and on the right here is a femur. 00:02:59And the drawings represent the forces that the beam is exposed to and the forces that the femur is exposed to. 00:03:07And we can see the trabecular patterns and the stress trajectories of this this beam and how they're kind of similar, right? 00:03:14And so that's sort of the inside. 00:03:15[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:18So the architecture of the human femur and it was compared with these sort of mathematically constructed stress trajectories on this beam. 00:03:29And that was to show how a human femur can be loaded in a single leg stance was sort of idealized. 00:03:37But the structure was called Coleman's Crane. 00:03:41And the  later stages of Paget's disease. 00:10:24In the middle, we have polydactyly in a ten month old child. 00:10:27And what you should note here is the six digit, right? 00:10:29So we have one, two, three, four, five, six. 00:10:35[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:37And finally, on the far right over here, we have congenital deformities in an eight-month-old girl, which include bowing of the femurs and bowing of the tibias with an absence of fibulas. 00:10:55There aren't any femurs aren't any fibula is present there are fevers present. 00:11:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:07So continuing with alignment, remember to contour bone, so we're looking at the general contour bone. 00:11 So continuing with alignment, remember to contour bone, so we're looking at the general contour bone. 00:11:14This includes internal and external irregularities. 00:11:18The cortical outline of each bone osteophytes breaks or gaps in the continuity of the cortex, or markings related to past surgeries. 00:11:29So some examples of internal and external irregularities could be related to disease or trauma or developmental or congenital factors. 00:11:39The cortical outline following should be smooth and continuous that we should imagine for example in the long run we should see this. 00:11:49Osteophytes or bony upwards that occur at joint margins that are usually associated with degenerative changes of cartilage. 00:11:58Along with those, a spur is an osteophyte that looks pointy and isolated, and can also form tension at tissue attachment sites. 00:12:08So breaks are gaps and the continuity of the cortex of  can also form tension at tissue attachment sites. 00:12:08So breaks are gaps and the continuity of the cortex of the bone signify a fracture usually markings related to surgical history can include bone graft donation sites or drill holes for surgical implants such as plates or other fixation devices. 00:12:26Note that alignment architecture and alignment contour aren't mutually exclusive. 00:12:32So for example, the dementia in general deformation in architecture also falls under bony contour. 00:12:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:47So continuing with some imaging examples here, we'll start on the left with this osteophyte or heel spur and this is seen as a radio-dense projection at the margin of the anterior inferior surface of the calcaneus. 00:13:02We can see that in the little black circle there. 00:13:06Next in the middle here we have an example of a cortical fracture, seen in  black circle there. 00:13:06Next in the middle here we have an example of a cortical fracture, seen in a complete fracture of the fifth metacarpal neck at the arrowhead here. 00:13:16This is referred to as a boxer's fracture. 00:13:22Finally, note the odd appearance of old surgical sites corresponding with the arrowheads. 00:13:29And this patient had a fibular fracture and a dislocation which was repaired with a plate running along the shaft of the fibula and compression screws across the tibia to reestablish the stability of the ankle bones. 00:13:42And you can see faint remnants of the drill holes. 00:13:45And there's these radiolucent lines, and you can also see faint lines across the tibia that are radio-dense. 00:13:51So hardware like this is usually not removed until it becomes problematic as a result of infection or loosening  00:13:51So hardware like this is usually not removed until it becomes problematic as a result of infection or loosening. 00:13:57So we can see these white arrows here, and corresponding with those, you can see faint lines right here. 00:14:05We have hardware and also right here we look at this arrow and see this pink line. 00:14:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:19Finally, under alignment number three, position of bones relative to other bones. 00:14:23So the alignment of bones relative to other bones, we want to assess for normal positional relationships, looking for fracture or dislocation or subluxation. 00:14:35And a fracture can disrupt a joint articulation, usually it's due to trauma. 00:14:40A dislocation will also disrupt normal articulation, also due to trauma. 00:14:45A subluxation, on the other hand,  disrupt normal articulation, also due to trauma. 00:14:45A subluxation, on the other hand, is a partial dislocation, and that can be related to trauma, but can also be related to degenerative changes that result in changes of the congruence between joint and joint laxity. 00:14:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:15:04So on the far left is a normal shoulder, followed by an image of the humerus posteriorly dislocated from the glenoid. 00:15:12And so the glenoid is this area right here, you can see. 00:15:17The humerus sort of obscures the posterior aspect of the glenoid in this picture on the left. 00:15:23However, on the right or in the middle here, you can see the full glenoid because that humerus is dislocated posteriorly. 00:15:32Now  you can see the full glenoid because that humerus is dislocated posteriorly. 00:15:32Now on the far right we see an image of a dislocated hip. 00:15:37And it's rare, and in this case it was the result of a road traffic accident and the patient underwent a closed reduction in recovery. 00:15:46And so what we can see here is this is where the femur should be, and this is where the femur hits 00:15:53[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com  of idealized. 00:03:37But the structure was called Coleman's Crane. 00:03:41And the takeaway here was really that besides the basic static relationships, the arrangement of the cross section, the inside of the bone and this beam. 00:03:55And the mechanical influences of the muscle tension, and the ligament tension, and the loading, those all influence the shape and the inner structure. 00:04:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:12And this was important because Wolf was basically convinced that the similarities between those stress trajectories in the brain on the left and the trabecular patterns and human femur were coincidental. 00:04:27And so he hypothesized that the direction and the pattern of loading influences or controls the pattern of the trabecular framework in the bone, so that's sort of the origin of Wolf's emphasis on mathematical laws. 00:04:41In other

the load that's imparted on that bone over time. 00:04:54[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:57So, remember that bone remodels continuously throughout life, and that the remodeling of bone is directly related to the function of the bone. 00:05:06And when we look at this slide up at the top, the first thing you'll see here is this ACL tear. 00:05:12And this is illustrating, for example, an A on the left, this is a bone that's been exposed to an ACL tear right here. 00:05:25And on the right, this is a bone that has not been exposed to an ACL tear. 00:05:30And so we see variations in bone shape that are associated with  not been exposed to an ACL tear. 00:05:30And so we see variations in bone shape that are associated with the abnormal kinematics, right, so the joints move differently after an ACL

00:06:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:59So, when viewing images, there are two kinds of errors when interpreting an image. 00:07:04One is an error of observation due to an incomplete or a faulty search pattern. 00:07:10Two are errors of interpretation, and that's the health care provider's failure to link the findings from the imaging to meaningful clinical data. 00:07:22Both of these can be reduced when the

images and interpreting the images, the more likely you are to get some useful information from that imaging, and the more likely you are to help the patient. 00:08:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:09So ABCS, the ABCs, how to search through radiologic imaging. 00:08:15And we have alignment, bone density, cartilage spaces, and soft tissues,  radiologic imaging. 00:08:15And we have alignment, bone density, cartilage spaces, and soft tissues, these are the four things that we look at. 00:08:24And ABCS is the search pattern for radiologic image interpretation. 00:08:29And note that there are three

00:08:45So we'll begin with alignment and alignment we're looking at skeletal architecture first. 00:08:51So skeletal architecture we're looking at changes in the size of bones or extra bones, congenital anomalies, the absence of bones or developmental deformities. 00:09:03And some examples for altered size of bones include gigantism, or has used disease or ac 4.3 Bone Remodeling and ABCS–A00:00:01So we'll continue with part three, general principles and radiology. 00:00:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:10And our objective in this lecture is to continue with the ABCs of how to begin a radiographic analysis. 00:00:19And in this lecture, we're going to explore bone density and cartilage space. 00:00:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:28So in the ABCDs for B, which stands for bone density, we're looking at number 1 of 3. 00:00:36And number 1 is skeletal architecture. 00:00:39So the general bone density is what we're looking at here, and we're going to assess the shade of gray, looking for shades of gray and then apply sufficient radiographic contrast between the bone and the soft tissue, and sufficient contrast within the bone itself  shades of gray and then apply sufficient radiographic contrast between the bone and the soft tissue, and sufficient contrast within the bone itself. 00:00:55So sufficient contrast between the bone and soft tissue, what this means is that healthy bone and soft tissue appear with clearly different or distinct shades of gray. 00:01:06And sufficient contrast within the bone itself means between the denser cortical shell of each bone and the less dense cancerous bone center. 00:01:16And the healthy cortex shows up with greater density than the cancerous bone, and it appears as a white margin along the bone shafts. 00:01:23And so what this means is that if we're looking at a long bone, the outside of the bone here, the edges will appear bright and the insides here will appear less bright. 00:01:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:46And on the left, we're looking at the normal density of a prox  will appear bright and the insides here will appear less bright. 00:01:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:46And on the left, we're looking at the normal density of a proximal femur. 00:01:51And on the right, we're looking at a femur with osteomalacia, so a femur with less density. 00:01:57So note that normal bone density is evident in the increased radiodensity and thickness of the margins of the femoral shaft, and that's where the outlines are here, right? 00:02:08So again, on the outside, we can see that it's more radio dense or brighter, and that's in contrast with the normally lesser radiodensity of the medullary cavity in the center of the bone here. 00:02:21So just like in the last slide, you can see that the center here is less dense than the outsides. 00: So just like in the last slide, you can see that the center here is less dense than the outsides. 00:02:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:35So osteomalacia on the slide on the right, that's also known as adult rickets, and this is a hypocalcification disorder, so less bone. 00:02:45As seen in this proximal femur, the body is able to produce bone, but it's not able to calcify it. 00:02:51So the result is a very wide but a porous femur, and the classic radiologic finding is a looser zone. 00:02:59A radiolucent band, which is transverse to the cortex, and it's an insufficiency stress fracture related to the demineralized cortex. 00:03:08And the slight increased radiodensity on either side of the fracture line is the bone's attempt to repair :03:08And the slight increased radiodensity on either side of the fracture line is the bone's attempt to repair that area of stress. 4.3 Bone Remodeling and ABCS–A00:00:01So we'll continue with part three, general principles and radiology. 00:00:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:10And our objective in this lecture is to continue with the ABCs of how to begin a radiographic analysis. 00:00:19And in this lecture, we're going to explore bone density and cartilage space. 00:00:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:28So in the ABCDs for B, which stands for bone density, we're looking at number 1 of 3. 00:00:36And number 1 is skeletal architecture. 00:00:39So the general bone density is what we're looking at here, and we're going to assess the shade :00:39So the general bone density is what we're looking at here, and we're going to assess the

appears as a white margin along the bone shafts. 00:01:23And so what this means is that if we're looking at a long bone, the outside of the bone here, the edges will appear bright and the insides here will appear less bright. 00: , the outside of the bone here, the edges will appear bright and the insides here will appear less bright. 00:01:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:46And on the left, we're looking at the normal density of a proximal femur. 00:01:51And on the right, we're looking at a femur with osteomalacia, so a femur with less density. 00:01:57So note that normal bone density is evident in the increased radiodensity and thickness of the margins of the femoral shaft, and that's where the outlines are here, right? 00:02:08So again, on the outside, we can see that it's more radio dense or brighter, and that's in contrast with the normally lesser radiodensity of the medullary cavity in the center of the bone here. 00:02:21So just like in the last slide, you can see that the center here  of the bone here. 00:02:21So just like in the last slide, you can see that the center here is less dense than the outsides. 00:02:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:35So osteomalacia on the slide on the right, that's also known as adult rickets, and this is a hypocalcification disorder, so less bone. 00:02:45As seen in this proximal femur, the body is able to produce bone, but it's not able to calcify it. 00:02:51So the result is a very wide but a porous femur, and the classic radiologic finding is a looser zone. 00:02:59A radiolucent band, which is transverse to the cortex, and it's an insufficiency stress fracture related to the demineralized cortex. 00:03:08And the slight increased radiodensity on either side of  related to the demineralized cortex. 00:03:08And the slight increased radiodensity on either side of the fracture line is the bone's attempt to repair that area of stress.  ANK_AUDIO] 00:01:46And on the left, we're looking at the normal density of a proximal femur. 00:01:51And on the right, we're looking at a femur with osteomalacia, so a femur with less density. 00:01:57So note that normal bone density is evident in the increased radiodensity and thickness of the margins of the femoral shaft, and that's where the outlines are here, right? 00:02:08So again, on the outside, we can see that it's more radio dense or brighter, and that's in contrast with the normally lesser radiodensity of the medullary cavity in the center of the bone here. 00:02:21So just like in the last slide, you can see that the center here is less dense than the outsides. 00:02:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:35So osteomalacia on  outsides. 00:02:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:35So osteomalacia on the slide on the right, that's also known as adult rickets, and this is a hypocalcification disorder, so less bone. 00:02:45As seen in this proximal femur, the body is able to produce bone, but it's not able to calcify it. 00:02:51So the result is a very wide but a porous femur, and the classic radiologic finding is a looser zone. 00:02:59A radiolucent band, which is transverse to the cortex, and it's an insufficiency stress fracture related to the demineralized cortex. 00:03:08And the slight increased radiodensity on either side of the fracture line is the bone's attempt to repair that area of stress. 4.3 Bone Remodeling and ABCS–A00:00  bone's attempt to repair that area of stress. 4.3 Bone Remodeling and ABCS–A00:00:01So we'll continue with part three, general principles and radiology. 00:00:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:10And our objective in this lecture is to continue with the ABCs of how to begin a radiographic analysis. 00:00:19And in this lecture, we're going to explore bone density and cartilage space. 00:00:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:28So in the ABCDs for B, which stands for bone density, we're looking at number 1 of 3. 00:00:36And number 1 is skeletal architecture. 00:00:39So the general bone density is what we're looking at here, and we're going to assess the shade of gray, looking for shades of gray and then apply sufficient radiographic contrast between the bone and the  going to assess the shade of gray, looking for shades of gray and then apply sufficient radiographic contrast between the bone and the soft tissue, and sufficient contrast within the bone itself. 00:00:55So sufficient contrast between the bone and soft tissue, what this means is that healthy bone and soft tissue appear with clearly different or distinct shades of gray. 00:01:06And sufficient contrast within the bone itself means between the denser cortical shell of each bone and the less dense cancerous bone center. 00:01:16And the healthy cortex shows up with greater density than the cancerous bone, and it appears as a white margin along the bone shafts. 00:01:23And so what this means is that if we're looking at a long bone, the outside of the bone here, the edges will appear bright and the insides here will appear less bright. 00:01:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:46And on the left,  less bright. 00:01:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:46And on the left, we're looking at the normal density of a proximal femur. 00:01:51And on the right, we're looking at a femur with osteomalacia, so a femur with less density. 00:01:57So note that normal bone density is evident in the increased radiodensity and thickness of the margins of the femoral shaft, and that's where the outlines are here, right? 00:02:08So again, on the outside, we can see that it's more radio dense or brighter, and that's in contrast with the normally lesser radiodensity of the medullary cavity in the center of the bone here. 00:02:21So just like in the last slide, you can see that the center here is less dense than the outsides. 00:02:28[BLANK_AUDIO]  see that the center here is less dense than the outsides. 00:02:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:35So osteomalacia on the slide on the right, that's also known as adult rickets, and this is a hypocalcification disorder, so less bone. 00:02:45As seen in this proximal femur, the body is able to produce bone, but it's not able to calcify it. 00:02:51So the result is a very wide but a porous femur, and the classic radiologic finding is a looser zone. 00:02:59A radiolucent band, which is transverse to the cortex, and it's an insufficiency stress fracture related to the demineralized cortex. 00:03:08And the slight increased radiodensity on either side of the fracture line is the bone's attempt to repair that area of stress. 4.3 Bone Rem ensity on either side of the fracture line is the bone's attempt to repair that area of stress. 4.3 Bone Remodeling and ABCS–A00:00:01So we'll continue with part three, general principles and radiology. 00:00:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:10And our objective in this lecture is to continue with the ABCs of how to begin a radiographic analysis. 00:00:19And in this lecture, we're going to explore bone density and cartilage space. 00:00:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:28So in the ABCDs for B, which stands for bone density, we're looking at number 1 of 3. 00:00:36And number 1 is skeletal architecture. 00:00:39So the general bone density is what we're looking at here, and we're going to assess the shade of gray, looking for shades of gray and then  what we're looking at here, and we're going to assess the shade of gray, looking for shades of gray and then apply sufficient radiographic contrast between the bone and the soft tissue, and sufficient contrast within the bone itself. 00:00:55So sufficient contrast between the bone and soft tissue, what this means is that healthy bone and soft tissue appear with clearly different or distinct shades of gray. 00:01:06And sufficient contrast within the bone itself means between the denser cortical shell of each bone and the less dense cancerous bone center. 00:01:16And the healthy cortex shows up with greater density than the cancerous bone, and it appears as a white margin along the bone shafts. 00:01:23And so what this means is that if we're looking at a long bone, the outside of the bone here, the edges will appear bright and the insides here will appear less bright. 00:01:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 4.4 ABCs–Soft Tissue00:00:00So lecture 4.4. 00:00:03We're going to continue along with our general principles and radiology. 00:00:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:10And our objective here is to continue with our ABCS radiographic analysis. 00:00:17And we've gotten through A and B and C alignment, bone and cartilage. 00:00:22Now we're on soft tissues, S. 00:00:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:28But before we get to our soft tissues, I want to backtrack a little bit to our last lecture, where we were talking about the epiphysis. 00:00:36And the Salter-Harris classification system addresses physeal fractures. 00:00:41On the left we have a type IV fracture of the distal tibia, and on the . 00:00:41On the left we have a type IV fracture of the distal tibia, and on the right we have normal epiphyseal plates. 00:00:48So here's an image of a patient who presented with ankle pain after being tackled while playing rugby. 00:00:54And this is a Salter-Harris type IV, where the fracture passes through the metaphysis, the growth plate and the epiphysis. 00:01:03And so, it's really faint again, you can see it's recording right here 00:01:13[BLANK_AUDIO] 4.4 ABCs–Soft Tissue00:00:00So lecture 4.4. 00:00:03We're going to continue along with our general principles and radiology. 00:00:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:10And our objective here is to continue with our ABCS radiographic analysis. ANK_AUDIO] 00:00:10And our objective here is to continue with our ABCS radiographic analysis. 00:00:17And we've gotten through A and B and C alignment, bone and cartilage. 00:00:22Now we're on soft tissues, S. 00:00:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:28But before we get to our soft tissues, I want to backtrack a little bit to our last lecture, where we were talking about the epiphysis. 00:00:36And the Salter-Harris classification system addresses physeal fractures. 00:00:41On the left we have a type IV fracture of the distal tibia, and on the right we have normal epiphyseal plates. 00:00:48So here's an image of a patient who presented with ankle pain after being tackled while playing rugby. 00:00:54And this is a Sal  of a patient who presented with ankle pain after being tackled while playing rugby. 00:00:54And this is a Salter-Harris type IV, where the fracture passes through the metaphysis, the growth plate and the epiphysis. 00:01:03And so, it's really faint again, you can see it's recording right here 00:01:13[BLANK_AUDIO]  4.5 Skeletal Pathology–Categories, Distribution, Predictors00:00:01So, we're going to continue with 4.5, Moral and General Principles in Radiology, 00:00:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:11And the objectives of this lecture are to identify categories of skeletal pathology. 00:00:17And provide examples of each, and identify the different distributions of skeletal pathology and provide examples of each. 00:00:24And finally, identify predictor variables of different skeletal pathology, and provide examples of each. 00:00:35So radiologic diagnosis of skeletal pathology. 00:00:39So skeletal pathology can be organized for diagnosis by identifying the category of pathology, distribution of the lesion, and the predictive variables that characterize the disease features. 00:00:52So in the picture on the right is a 54 year old with benign osteochondromas and the proximal humerus be you can  picture on the right is a 54 year old with benign osteochondromas and the proximal humerus be you can see that. 00:01:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:09See that right here? 00:01:12And this is sort of orient yourself, right? 00:01:15[INAUDIBLE] Okay. 00:01:21So in the proximal humerus and then in the proximal and distal femur C. 00:01:28And so here's our femur, 00:01:30[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:37So we can see that it's sort of a funny shape there. 00:01:40[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:43All right, and then also in the proximal tibia, D. 00:01:47And so, down here is our tibia, again, in a really funny ibia, D. 00:01:47And so, down here is our tibia, again, in a really funny shape. 00:01:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:02And so, if we identify the category of the pathology, the category here is neoplastic, or identifying the distribution of the lesion. 00:02:11The distribution is diffuse, all right, so we can see that it's throughout the body. 00:02:18And then the predictor variables are osteoblastic. 00:02:22You can see that it creates me a bone if you look up in B, right and see this new bone here. 00:02:28If we look at the femur here, you can see that femurs made a new bone if we look at the tibia here, you can see that the tibia has created a new bone here. 00:02:37And in terms of location, it  can see that the tibia has created a new bone here. 00:02:37And in terms of location, it's usually located around the knee of the distal femur and the proximal humerus, and that's what we see in the images in this patient. 00:02:49It's usually in the metaphysis or the diaphysis. 00:02:53It occurs in men more than women. 4.5 Skeletal

humerus and then in the proximal and distal femur C. 00:01:28And so here imal humerus and then in the proximal and distal femur C. 00:01:28And so here's our femur, 00:01:30[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:37So we can see that it's sort of a funny shape there. 00:01:40[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:43All right, and then also in the proximal tibia, D. 00:01:47And so, down here is our tibia, again, in a really funny shape. 00:01:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:02And so, if we identify the category of the pathology, the category here is neoplastic, or identifying the distribution of the lesion. 00:02:11The distribution is diffuse,

Report00:00:01So we'll continue our discussion on general principles in radiology with lecture 4.6 here. 00:00:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:11The objectives for this portion include to describe the purposes of the radiologic report. 00:00:19Define the 4 D's sequential tasks used in radiologist reporting. 00:00:26Describe the components of a typical radiology report. 00:00:29And number 4, explain two ways a physical therapist might help a patient feel more comfortable or satisfied with their imaging results. 00:00:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:42So we'll start with the radiology report. 00:00:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:49So the purposes of the radiologic report, first to link the radiologic signs with the patient history and the examination findings, and then  purposes of the radiologic report, first to link the radiologic signs with the patient history and the examination findings, and then to provide a comparison with earlier or later radiological examinations, to have a permanent record. 00:01:06And the report supports the treatment through identified indications and contraindications for the medical intervention. 00:01:14And the report can be used for research, and it also facilitates communication. 00:01:19Usually, the report contains information about the patient demographics and imaging findings, and a conclusion along with the radiologist's name and signature. 4.6 The

Closed Fractures and Complications. 00:00:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:25And objectives for this lecture include describe complications of fractures that could become life threatening and define open versus closed fracture. 00:00:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:40So let's start by talking about fractures from trauma. 00:00:44So imaging of musculoskeletal trauma is performed by radiography, usually X-ray. 00:00:50And the therapist should be aware of what imaging was performed at the emergency department, and this is called a primary trauma survey. 00:00:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:03For example, here, a primary trauma survey :00:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:03For example, here, a primary trauma survey for a motor vehicle accident or a fall may include a cross-table lateral of the cervical spine. 00:01:13And this is to assess for gross instability, fractures, or dislocations. 00:01:17It may also include an AP view of the chest to assess for hemothorax, or pneumothorax, or pulmonary contusion. 5.1 Fractures and ComplicationsEffects00:00:00[MUSIC] 00:00:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:10So this is lecture 5.1 Open and Closed Fractures and Complications. 00:00:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:25And objectives for this lecture include describe complications of fractures that could become life threatening and define open versus closed fracture. 00:00:34[BLANK_  describe complications of fractures that could

assess for hemothorax, or pneumothorax, or pulmonary contusion.  5.2 7 Elements of a FractureEffects00:00:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:01So this is lecture 5.2, the 7 elements of a fracture. 00:00:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:09And so our objective here is to identify the 7 elements that describe a fracture. 00:00:15[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:18So the 7 elements of a fracture include, number 1, the anatomic site and the extent of the fracture, the type of the fracture, whether it's complete or incomplete, the alignment of the fracture fragments, the direction of the fracture line. 00:00:35Number 5, special features of the fracture such as impaction or avulsion. 00:00:40Number 6, associated abnormalities, such as a joint dislocation. 00:00:45And number 7, special types of fractures resulting from abnormal stress or pathological  as a joint dislocation. 00:00:45And number 7, special types of fractures resulting from abnormal stress or pathological processes in the bone, such as stress fractures or pathological fractures. 00:00:55[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:00So the first element is the anatomic site and extent of the fracture. 00:01:05So bones may be referenced by standard anatomic landmarks or parts, like the surgical neck of the humerus or the intertrochanteric region of the femur, or the supracondylar area of a distal femur. 00:01:19The shaft of a long bone is divided into thirds and the junctions between each of those regions. 00:01:25The ends of the long bones are classified as the distal and the proximal end, with each end then divided into extra-articular, the outside articular surface or outside the joint ,and the intra-art  each end then divided into extra-articular, the outside articular surface or outside the joint ,and the intra-articular, so within the articular surface or within the joint surface area. 00:01:44And fractures can extend from the extra-articular area to the intra-articular area. 00:01:50And so we can see in this bone diagram. 00:01:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:55Now, we have the extra-articular surface here and the intra-articular surface. 00:02:00And this is intra-articular because we can imagine here's the pelvis, and so this area is inside the joint. 00:02:07This is the proximal end of the femur, and then down here is the distal end of the femur. 00:02:12[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:19So in these images on the top . 00:02:12[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:19So in these images on the top, we see an intra-articular fracture, and in the bottom, we see an extra-articular fracture. 00:02:28So this is an AP view of a knee with a distal femur fracture that is intra-articular. 00:02:34The fracture extends through the intracondylar notch and the medial condyle is displaced medially and inferiorly. 00:02:42So the fracture is right through here, right, extends through the intracondylar notch, right there, and the medial condyle is displaced medially, which is that way ,and inferiorly, which is that way. 5.2 7 Elements of a FractureEffects00:00:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:01So this is lecture 5.2, the 7 elements of a fracture. ANK_AUDIO] 00:00:01So this is lecture 5.2, the 7 elements of a fracture. 00:00:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:09And so our objective here is to identify the 7 elements that describe a fracture. 00:00:15[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:18So the 7 elements of a fracture include, number 1, the anatomic site and the extent of the fracture, the type of the fracture, whether it's complete or incomplete, the alignment of the fracture fragments, the direction of the fracture line. 00:00:35Number 5, special features of the fracture such as impaction or avulsion. 00:00:40Number 6, associated abnormalities, such as a joint dislocation. 00:00:45And number 7, special types of fractures resulting from abnormal stress or pathological processes in the bone, such as stress fractures or pathological fractures. 00:00:  of fractures resulting from abnormal stress or pathological processes in the bone, such as stress fractures or pathological fractures. 00:00:55[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:00So the first element is the anatomic site and extent of the fracture. 00:01:05So bones may be referenced by standard anatomic landmarks or parts, like the surgical neck of the humerus or the intertrochanteric region of the femur, or the supracondylar area of a distal femur. 00:01:19The shaft of a long bone is divided into thirds and the junctions between each of those regions. 00:01:25The ends of the long bones are classified as the distal and the proximal end, with each end then divided into extra-articular, the outside articular surface or outside the joint ,and the intra-articular, so within the articular surface or within the joint surface area. 00:  the joint ,and the intra-articular, so within the articular surface or within the joint surface area. 00:01:44And fractures can extend from the extra-articular area to the intra-articular area. 00:01:50And so we can see in this bone diagram. 00:01:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:55Now, we have the extra-articular surface here and the intra-articular surface. 00:02:00And this is intra-articular because we can imagine here's the pelvis, and so this area is inside the joint. 00:02:07This is the proximal end of the femur, and then down here is the distal end of the femur. 00:02:12[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:19So in these images on the top, we see an intra-articular fracture, and in the bottom, we see 19So in these images on the top, we see an intra-articular fracture, and in the bottom, we see an extra-articular fracture. 00:02:28So this is an AP view of a knee with a distal femur fracture that is intra-articular. 00:02:34The fracture extends through the intracondylar notch and the medial condyle is displaced medially and inferiorly. 00:02:42So the fracture is right through here, right, extends through the intracondylar notch, right there, and the medial condyle is displaced medially, which is that way ,and inferiorly, which is that way.  5.3 Fractures in Children00:00:01Hi, so we're continuing care with 5.3, fractures in children and the Salter-Harris classification. 00:00:11So our objectives for 5.3 are first to describe the unique patterns of injury and special problems and diagnosis treatment and healing of fractures in children. 00:00:22And then second, to define the Salter-Harris classification system. 00:00:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:29So fractures of children, these are complicated by features that resemble a fracture, right? 00:00:34Like growth plate for both lines, secondary centers of ossification, and then also large nutrient parameter. 00:00:43So all of the above things can be confused with fracture lines. 00:00:46And so therefore, comparison films of the uninvolved side are also very useful. 00:00:51And we mentioned this in a prior lecture  comparison films of the uninvolved side are also very useful. 00:00:51And we mentioned this in a prior lecture. 00:00:53I mentioned this in a prior lecture, that symmetry is really your friend when doing some of these images. 00:01:00Comparing one extremity to the other, 00:01:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:07An additional difficulty in radiographically examining immature bone, is that only the ossified portions of the bone have sufficient radiographic density to be imaged. 5.3 Fractures in Children00:00:01Hi, so we're continuing care with 5.3, fractures in children and the Salter-Harris classification. 00:00:11So our objectives for 5.3 are first to describe the unique patterns of injury and special problems and diagnosis treatment and healing of fractures in children. 00:00:22And then second, to define the Salter-Harris classification  treatment and healing of fractures in children. 00:00:22And then second, to define the Salter-Harris classification system. 00:00:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:29So fractures of children, these are complicated by features that resemble a fracture, right? 00:00:34Like growth plate for both lines, secondary centers of ossification, and then also large nutrient parameter. 00:00:43So all of the above things can be confused with fracture lines. 00:00:46And so therefore, comparison films of the uninvolved side are also very useful. 00:00:51And we mentioned this in a prior lecture. 00:00:53I mentioned this in a prior lecture, that symmetry is really your friend when doing some of these images. 00:01:00Comparing one extremity to the other, 00:01:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:07An additional difficulty ity to the other, 00:01:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:07An additional difficulty in radiographically examining immature bone, is that only the ossified portions of the bone have sufficient radiographic density to be imaged.  5.4 Fracture Reduction00:00:01Okay, so welcome to Lecture 5.4, and this lecture will cover fracture reduction, open and closed fracture, external and internal. 00:00:12Not fraction, fracture, external and internal. 00:00:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:18So the objectives for Lecture 5.4 are to describe the differences between open reduction and closed reduction of a fracture, and describe the differences between internal and external fixation of a fracture. 00:00:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:38Reduction and fixation of fractures. 00:00:41Reduction is the restoration of displaced bone fragments to their normal anatomic position, and this occurs either through closed or open reduction. 00:00:51Closed reduction, no incisions are made and manipulation, traction, or both are used to guide the fragments into place. 00:01:00In open reduction  made and manipulation, traction, or both are used to guide the fragments into place. 00:01:00In open reduction, an incision is made to expose the fracture site, and after reduction the fracture fragments are kept in position through fixation. 00:01:10[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:12So during closed reductions of fractures, again, no surgical incisions are made, rather the fragments are physically guided back into position through manipulation, traction, or a combination of manipulation and traction. 00:01:27In most fractures a soft tissue pin will be present between the bone ends. 5.4 Fracture Reduction00:00:01Okay, so welcome to Lecture 5.4, and this lecture will cover fracture reduction, open and closed fracture, external and internal. 00:00:12Not fraction, fracture, external and internal. 00:00:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:18So the objectives for Lect  and internal. 00:00:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:18So the objectives for Lecture 5.4 are to describe the differences between open reduction and closed reduction of a fracture, and describe the differences between internal and external fixation of a fracture. 00:00:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:38Reduction and fixation of fractures. 00:00:41Reduction is the restoration of displaced bone fragments to their normal anatomic position, and this occurs either through closed or open reduction. 00:00:51Closed reduction, no incisions are made and manipulation, traction, or both are used to guide the fragments into place. 00:01:00In open reduction, an incision is made to expose the fracture site, and after reduction the fracture fragments are kept in position through fixation. 00:01:10[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:12So during closed reductions of fractures, again  00:01:10[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:12So during closed reductions of fractures, again, no surgical incisions are made, rather the fragments are physically guided back into position through manipulation, traction, or a combination of manipulation and traction. 00:01:27In most fractures a soft tissue pin will be present between the bone ends.  5.5 Fracture HealingEffects00:00:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:02Okay, so welcome to lecture 5.5, Fracture Healing, Missed Fractures, and Professional Communication. 00:00:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:13So, the objectives for 5.5 are to identify factors which influence the timeframe for fracture healing. 00:00:22Identify three causes of commonly missed fractures and describe the importance of professional collaboration, and communication with regards to patient outcomes. 00:00:31[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:35So we'll begin with the overlapping phases of fractured healing and the timeframe for complete fracture healing is divisable into three phases that overlap a little bit. 00:00:47The inflammation phase occupies around 10% of the total healing time, the reparative phase occupies around 40% and the remodeling phase takes up about 70% of the total  healing time, the reparative phase occupies around 40% and the remodeling phase takes up about 70% of the total healing time. 00:01:00So the vast majority of fracture healing time is dedicated to remodeling. 00:01:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:09So the timeframe for fracture healing is generally 4-8 weeks. 00:01:14The actual time and the process of healing is influenced by a number of factors, so we can take, for example, the distal radius, 00:01:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:32And the median healing time is around 5.6 weeks, so the recommended length of immobilization is around six weeks. 00:01:41On the other hand, take a look here at the scaphoid, the median healing time in weeks is around 7.7 weeks but the recommended length of a mobilization for the scaphoid is between 6 and  a pseudarthrosis, can develop between the fragment ends of the bone. 00:03:48Infection at a fracture site results in delayed or complete lack of healing because the local cell response is focused on containing or eliminating the infection, instead of healing the bone. 00:04:01Unless a malignancy is treated, fractures through a primary or secondary malignant tumor will not demonstrate meaningful healing. 00:04:10Fractures through a nonmalignant but abnormal bone may heal but in some instances such as Paget's disease or fibrous dysplasia healing may be delayed or may not even happen at all. 00:04:21[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:27The last four factors we're going to discuss which influence healing include radiation necrosis, avascular necrosis, hormones and exercise and local stress about the fracture. 00:04:40Bone exposed to radiation heals more slowly and may fail to unite because of cell death,  the fracture. 00:04:40Bone exposed to radiation heals more slowly and may fail to unite because of cell death, vessel thrombosis and fibrosis of marrow. 00:04:49Usually bone healing occurs from both ends of the fracture site, but if one fragment is avascular, then healing must proceed from one side only, and this can delay the process.   time in weeks is around 7.7 weeks but the recommended length of a mobilization for the scaphoid is between 6 and 12 weeks. 00:01:54So quite a bit of variability and I think that's probably what I'd like you to take away from this slide. 00:02:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:05So we'll cover 12 factors that influence fracture healing, the first is the age of the patient, number two is the degree of local trauma, and the degree of bone loss and the type of bone involved. 00:02:19So, generally, the younger a patient, the more rapidly the fracture will heal. 00:02:24The greater local trauma at the fracture site and an adjacent soft tissue results in delays to fracture healing. 00:02:32More tissues involved in the injury diffuse the cellular repair effort, delaying healing and greater displacement of the fracture fragments are also known to delay fracture healing. 00:02  the cellular repair effort, delaying healing and greater displacement of the fracture fragments are also known to delay fracture healing. 00:02:43The loss of bone, substance, or excessive distraction of the fragments compromises the ability of the cells to bridge that gap at the fracture site, and that also can contribute to a delay in healing. 00:02:55Cancellous bone unites rapidly, but only at points of direct contact between the bone. 00:03:01Cortical bone unites by two mechanisms depending on the local conditions. 00:03:06A rigid, immobilized site with contact of fragments will heal faster than a poorly immobilized site with displacement 00:03:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:20The next four factors that influence healing include degree of immobilization, infection, local malignancy and nonmalignant local pathological conditions. 00:03:32So inadequate immobilization leads to delayed union or even to nonunion of malignant local pathological conditions. 00:03:32So inadequate immobilization leads to delayed union or even to nonunion of the bones. 00:03:38If movement persists during the repair process, a cleft or false joint, of a pseudarthrosis, can develop between the fragment ends of the bone. 00:03:48Infection at a fracture site results in delayed or complete lack of healing because the local cell response is focused on containing or eliminating the infection, instead of healing the bone. 00:04:01Unless a malignancy is treated, fractures through a primary or secondary malignant tumor will not demonstrate meaningful healing. 00:04:10Fractures through a nonmalignant but abnormal bone may heal but in some instances such as Paget's disease or fibrous dysplasia healing may be delayed or may not even happen at all. 00:04:21[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:27The last four factors we  at all. 00:04:21[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:27The last four factors we're going to discuss which influence healing include radiation necrosis, avascular necrosis, hormones and exercise and local stress about the fracture. 00:04:40Bone

but if one fragment is avascular, then healing must proceed from one side only, and this can delay the process. 5.5 Fracture HealingEffects00:00:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:02Okay, so welcome to lecture 5.5, Fracture Healing, Missed Fractures, and Professional Communication. 00:00:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:13So, the objectives for 5.5 are to 00:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:13So, the objectives for 5.5 are to identify factors which influence the timeframe for fracture healing. 00:00:22Identify three causes of commonly missed fractures and describe the importance of professional collaboration, and

takes up about 70% of the total healing time. 00:01:00So the vast majority of fracture healing time is dedicated to remodeling. 00:01:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:09So the timeframe for fracture healing is generally 4- 01:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:09So the timeframe for fracture healing is generally 4-8 weeks. 00:01:14The actual time and the process of healing is influenced by a number of factors, so we can take, for example, the distal radius, 00:01:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:32And the median healing time is around 5.6 weeks, so the recommended length of immobilization is around six weeks. 00:01:41On the

pseudarthrosis, can develop between the fragment ends of the bone. 00:03:48Infection at a 7.1 What is CT?Effects00:00:00[MUSIC] 00:00:11So lecture 7, Computed Tomography, what is CT? 00:00:15[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:23So, our objectives for this lecture are to be able to explain in lay terms what CT is and then describe how CT images are created. 00:00:33And as an aside, my goal with introducing you to these different imaging modalities, is to try and give you enough information without overwhelming you with all of the tiny details. 00:00:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:49So, this is a CT machine that you might see in a typical imaging center or a hospital and this platform, here at the patient would lie on. 00:01:00And then the platform would move the patient into the tube. 00:01:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:  then the platform would move the patient into the tube. 00:01:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:10So what is CT, well, CT is a medical imaging technique which uses x-rays to build detailed cross-sectional images of the body. 00:01:21The picture we're looking at here is a case of polyarticular gout. 00:01:26So this patient presented with generalized edema of the foot and ankle and there's well defined erosion of the first proximal phalangeal head medially, and we can see the green areas are crystal deposition. 00:01:42Which is actually monosodium urate crystals and these are the agent responsible for this acute inflammatory condition that we call gout.  7.2 CT vs Conventional Radiography00:00:01So Lecture 7.2, [UNKNOWN] how is CT different from Conventional Radiography? 00:00:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:11Our objectives for this Lecture 7.2 are to identify how CT scanning data is different from standard radiographs, or x-rays. 00:00:21And describe the advantages and disadvantages of CT. 00:00:25And identify two settings in which CT is the preferred modality. 00:00:31So CT versus x-ray or conventional radiography. 00:00:35They both employ x rays, but the CT reconstructs images from multiple scans along cross-sectional slices while X rays create an image from a single scan. 00:00:45This is what we covered in the prior lecture, while we rotate the emitter and the receptor and collect images from a number of different angles,  covered in the prior lecture, while we rotate the emitter and the receptor and collect images from a number of different angles, and then assemble all that data into a much more complex image. 00:01:01So modern CT scanning, well, it used to be that the x-ray tube moved circumferentially around the patient as we saw in those early slides that I showed you. 00:01:12We had this, 00:01:13[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:18Tube like that and the x-rays looked around like this and you had a table, right? 00:01:30And so the circle would be completed and a number of projections would be collected. 00:01:37And then the table with the patient on it would advance just a little bit. 00:01:42And a new slice would be taken and the emitter would rotate all the way around the patient, taking images from a bunch of different  new slice would be taken and the emitter would rotate all the way around the patient, taking images from a bunch of different angles, and then the table would advance again and the process would repeat. 00:01:56And so you have this delay between each slice. 00:02:00Now there are what are called spiral scanners and they don't have that stop and go action. 00:02:07And instead they move continuously during the examination process. 00:02:11And this results in a slice that is an axial, but is helical, right? 00:02:16So, instead of going around in a circle, you have a slice that goes around like that. 00:02:27And so data is collected by a number of detector rows simultaneously and those multiple detector row scanners or what are called multislice CT or MSCT scanners. 00:02:42They really represent a major advance in the ability to acquire large volumes of data with  MSCT scanners. 00:02:42They really represent a major advance in the ability to acquire large volumes of data with high accuracy and much shorter imaging times. 00:02:52And so this is an example of a CT arthrography of the knee and orthogonal planes are employed in both CT and MRI. 00:03:01And the imaging example here is from a CT arthrography study of the knee as I mentioned, and can see a coronal, sagittal and axial plane. 00:03:12So as opposed to the last slide with the orthogonal planes produced by a CT, this is also a CT of the lateral left ankle.  7.3 Neuroimaging00:00:01So this is lecture 7.3 computer tomography and some MR neural imaging. 00:00:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:11And the objectives for this lecture are to define structural neural imaging. 00:00:17Define functional neural imaging. 00:00:19Describe ideal use cases for CT neural imaging, and describe ideal use cases for MR neural imaging. 00:00:28So structural imaging is examining the anatomy of the brain to diagnose pathology. 00:00:37The physical structure and functional imaging is monitoring activity in the brain based on metabolic activity. 00:00:44So this is used in research and to diagnose pathology that's too small to be detected via physical or structural changes. 00:00:54When discussing CT neuroimaging and MR neuroimaging, CT versus MRI, in an acute setting, CT is the modality of choice because of the short scan  neuroimaging, CT versus MRI, in an acute setting, CT is the modality of choice because of the short scan time. 00:01:07MRI typically takes longer to complete a scan. 00:01:11A head CT is the standard protocol in trauma for immediate assessment of intracranial bleeding. 00:01:17MRI also plays a large role in detecting changes in fluid content, or ischemia, or edema, and hemorrhage. 00:01:25And it does this more accurately than a CT, again, at the expense of time.  7.4 fMRI, PET, and EEGEffects00:00:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:02This is lecture 74 we're going to continue with computer tomography and STEM magnetic resonance imaging functional MRI and EEG 00:00:13[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:16So our objective here is to by the end of the lecture, we should be able to explain the differences between functional fMRI, PET and EEG. 00:00:26Including examples of use-cases, advantages and disadvantages. 00:00:32MRI neuroimaging and it's used for a visualization of brain soft tissue. 00:00:38One of the benefits is that there's no exposure to radiation with MRI. 00:00:42However, it can't be used or it's difficult to use with individuals who are uncomfortable in enclosed spaces. 00:00:51And it also can't be used in patients who have metallic implants  who are uncomfortable in enclosed spaces. 00:00:51And it also can't be used in patients who have metallic implants. 00:00:56Or who don't tolerate loud environments very well. 00:00:59Functional MRI or fMRI. 00:01:03This is used for localization of brain activity associated with a cognitive task or behavior. 00:01:10However, it has limited resolution and it's really an indirect measure of brain activity. 00:01:16Because the activity is measured via metabolic changes that are occurring. 00:01:22Positron emission tomography, PET. 00:01:25This is useful for localization of brain activity associated with performing a cognitive task or behavior. 00:01:32It's silence and it tracks various metabolites such as glucose. 00:01:38The drawback here is that there's very poor spatial resolution. 00:01:41It requires radioactive tracers, it's very expensive. 00  that there's very poor spatial resolution. 00:01:41It requires radioactive tracers, it's very expensive. 00:01:46It's limited to short tasks, again, due to the radiation exposure. 00:01:50Like the fMRI, it's an indirect measure of brain activity. 00:01:56EEG, electroencephalogram and ERP, evoked and related potentials. 00:02:03So this is a direct recording of electrical brain activity associated with a cognitive task or behavior. 00:02:10It's silent, non-invasive, it's low cost. 00:02:14The brain activity can be directly as opposed to indirectly associated with an event or stimulus. 00:02:19However, very poor spatial resolution versus fMRI and the analysis of the results that you get from an EEG can be very complex. 00:02:31MRI based neural imaging techniques. 00:02:34We'll  an EEG can be very complex. 00:02:31MRI based neural imaging techniques. 00:02:34We'll start with the image on the left, which is a structural MRI. 00:02:38This reveals the gross anatomical structure of the brain with high detail, and in this case, in a sagittal view. 00:02:46Now, just to the right of that, we have a diffusion MRI. 00:02:50This reveals the overall layout of white matter connections and pathways within the brain. 00:02:56This is referred to as tractography because we're going to be looking at tracks the color scheme corresponds to the orientation of the white matter fibers. 00:03:05And so the green tract represents fibers extending between the front and the back of the brain. 00:03:12Red is for fibers that run from the left to the right. 00:03:16And blue is fibers that run along the axis from the top  run from the left to the right. 00:03:16And blue is fibers that run along the axis from the top to the bottom of the brain. 00:03:22And then finally over in C on the far right, we have a functional MRI. 00:03:27And this reveals areas of the brain that are active when an individual is asked to perform a particular task. 00:03:33[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:35In this case, an individual who is congenitally blind was asked to identify a tactile pattern through touch. 00:03:43So no areas of activation identified throughout the brain in yellow, including within the occipital cortex. 00:03:50Which is normally associated with visual information processing and that's identified by the yellow arrow here. 00:03:57[BLANK_AUDIO]  _AUDIO]  7.5 What is MRI00:00:02So, magnetic resonance imaging, what is an MRI image? 00:00:06And we discussed MRI briefly in the last section in relationship to MR neural imaging and so we'll get into a little more detail here in this lecture 00:00:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:19So, the objective here is to describe in general how magnetic resonance images are created. 00:00:26So, this is an image created in 1976, and this is the first MRI scan of a human and it's the cross-section of a research student's finger. 00:00:37What is MRI? 00:00:39MRI is an imaging technology that uses a magnetic field and radio frequency signals to create cross-sectional images, and there's no exposure to ionizing radiation. 00:00:50A key here is that biological tissues contain around 75% water, and that water can be easily detected  00:00:50A key here is that biological tissues contain around 75% water, and that water can be easily detected by magnetic resonance. 00:01:02So as opposed to X-rays, the MRI uses energy emitted from a hydrogen nuclei after they've been stimulated by radio frequency signals. 00:01:11So, radio frequency, those signals cause hydrogen nuclei to emit signals, and those signals are then converted to images by a computer. 00:01:28So, MRI was initially called Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging or NMR or NMRI, because of its early use in chemical analysis. 00:01:38However, the nuclear part was dropped about 25 years ago because of fears that people would think that there was something radioactive involved, which there's not.  7.6 Proton Alignment and Energy ReleaseEffects00:00:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:02So, Lecture 7.6, we're going to go a little more in depth about MRIs and talk about magnetic resonance imaging and the proton alignment and energy release that eventually leads to the ability to produce images. 00:00:16So our objectives for this lecture include being able to define longitudinal magnetization and identify the basic principles of MRI regarding the radiofrequency pulse, proton displacement, realignment, and the release of energy. 00:00:34Principles of MRI, alignment of protons and altering that alignment. 00:00:39The process of image acquisition begins by placing the patient in a scanner with an extremely strong magnetic field. 00:00:48There's a slight difference between the number of protons lining up parallel with the magnetic field and the number of photons lining up in the opposite direction. 00:00  of protons lining up parallel with the magnetic field and the number of photons lining up in the opposite direction. 00:00:57And this difference between the protons that line up parallel and those that line up in the opposite direction gives rise to net magnetization parallel with the external magnetic field, and that's referred to as longitudinal magnetization. 00:01:14Pulses of radiofrequency waves are then applied at right angles to that longitudinal magnetization. 00:01:21And these pulses of radiofrequency waves alter the alignment of the protons to a transverse plane. 00:01:28And the energy absorbed in that process brings those protons to a higher energy state. 00:01:35[BLANK_AUDIO]  7.7 T1 and T2 Weighted Images00:00:01So, lecture 77 and this lecture is on magnetic resonance imaging, T1 weighted and T2 weighted images. 00:00:10And I briefly mentioned these in the past lecture. 00:00:15So our objectives for this lecture include at the end, you should be able to describe how protons returning to alignment with the magnetic field create T1 and T2 images. 00:00:27Should be able to define T1-weighted and T2-weighted images, including the differences between them. 00:00:33And finally, you should be able to identify which structures on MRI sequences show different signal intensities. 00:00:40On T1 versus T2- weighted images in general. 00:00:44So T1 and T2, the protons returned to alignment with a magnetic field and as they do that, they release energy. 00:00: , the protons returned to alignment with a magnetic field and as they do that, they release energy. 00:00:52So the protons realign with the magnetic field. 00:00:55And as they do that they gain longitudinal magnetization, but they lose their transverse magnetization. 00:01:03So my poor drawing skills here again, and the protons initially align that direction. 00:01:11And as they return to their original orientation, there's this release of energy. 00:01:20These are my energy lines as energy's released here, okay? 00:01:28[BLANK_AUDIO]  8.1 Musculoskeletal Ultrasound: What is it?Effects00:00:00[MUSIC] 00:00:09So welcome to week eight, and the first lecture is on musculoskeletal ultrasound. 00:00:14So we're going to start with musculoskeletal ultrasound. 00:00:17What is musculoskeletal ultrasound? 00:00:21[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:24So our objectives are to describe how energy is converted to sound waves and how those sound waves are transformed into an image in the process of ultrasound imaging. 00:00:35Then we're going to identify the common equipment and functionality of the equipment used in ultrasound imaging. 00:00:41We'll discuss the difference in equipment shape and image between linear and curvilinear transducers, and describe how frequency affects ultrasound image resolution. 00:00:51[BLANK_AUDIO inear transducers, and describe how frequency affects ultrasound image resolution. 00:00:51[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:55Ultrasound imaging. 00:00:57In ultrasound imaging, images are created from sound waves which are reflective of tissues and the interfaces between tissues. 00:01:05The origins of ultrasound imaging are in sonar. 00:01:09And sonar stands for sound navigation and ranging, which was prevalent on submarines during World War II.  8.2 How does Tissue Affect US Imaging00:00:01So welcome to lecture 8.2. 00:00:03How does tissue affect ultrasound? 00:00:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:10So our objectives are to define ultrasound attenuation, including reflection, refraction, absorption and scattering. 00:00:19Describe why ultrasonography is considered real-time imaging. 00:00:23Identify some of the advantages and disadvantages of ultrasound versus MRI. 00:00:29And define rehabilitative ultrasound imaging, RUSI. 00:00:33[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:36So the interaction between ultrasound and tissues. 00:00:40Some of the energy emitted by the transducer gets reflected back and some is absorbed by tissues and converted to heat energy. 00:00:48Now, diagnostic ultrasound does not produce enough energy to cause a measurable rise in tissue temperature  heat energy. 00:00:48Now, diagnostic ultrasound does not produce enough energy to cause a measurable rise in tissue temperature. 00:00:55The energy emitted by the transducer is attenuated or offset through reflection, refraction, absorption and scattering. 00:01:05So, this is a simplified image of ultrasound attenuation. 00:01:09And we can see here that some of the energy that is emitted by the transducer, which is here is absorbed, some is reflected.  8.3 Transducer Orientation Affects What You See00:00:01So lecture 83, how transducer orientation affects what you see. 00:00:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:09Our goal for this lecture is to be able to describe how the orientation of the transducer affects the image specifically with regard to longitudinal versus transverse orientation. 00:00:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:23So, a diagnostic ultrasound, this is the longitudinal or long-axis view. 00:00:30And so, the long head of the biceps tendon with a longitudinal view, you can imagine that the, 00:00:37[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:40Transducer is going to be oriented this way. 00:00:45And so what we see here is the humerus, and then tendon, and then the deltoid muscle over the top  so what we see here is the humerus, and then tendon, and then the deltoid muscle over the top of it. 00:00:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:03And if we're looking down on the patient, this is the longitudinal view, here's the transducer, like that. 00:01:10[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:13So this is the long axis view. 00:01:16And these are illustrations showing, how to identify the long head of the biceps tendon in the longitudinal plane, and the patient has their arm facing anteriorly with the elbow flexed. 00:01:28And usually they're just asked to rest their hand on their lap at the palm of their hand facing upward. 00:01:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:35Okay, so the transducer head orientation right? 00:01:39Here right IO] 00:01:35Okay, so the transducer head orientation right? 00:01:39Here right, this reflects the fact that this is a longitudinal view of the biceps tendon because the transducer had long axis and is parallel to the biceps tendon. 00:01:51[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:54Okay, so here, this right here is a humorous. 00:01:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:02Okay, and so for a longitudinal view of the long head of the bicep tendon, the transducer is applied along the tendon, and the resulting image shows a sagittal slice of the tendon. 00:02:13And the top part of the transducer is usually represented along the left side of the image over here. 00:02:20And the right side of the image will reference the bottom part of the transducer and the longitudinal view. 02:20And the right side of the image will reference the bottom part of the transducer and the longitudinal view. 00:02:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:30Okay, so again we have the humerus, and we have the tendon right here. 00:02:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:38Then over the top here we have the deltoid muscle.  8.4 Echogenicity00:00:02Lecture 84, Echogenicity-Reflected Signal Amplitude. 00:00:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:10So the objectives for this lecture are to be able to define echogenicity and how it affects the ultrasound image, and identify which structures have the highest signal amplitude and which have low signal amplitude. 00:00:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:27So echogenicity refers to the degree to which tissues reflect sound waves. 00:00:33On the left we have a transverse image of the long head of the biceps tendon, actually, there it is. 00:00:41[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:47And the subscapularis tendon, which is here. 00:00:51[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:55And the bicipital groove  here. 00:00:51[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:55And the bicipital groove, which is right here, surrounding the biceps tendon on these sides. 00:01:04And then the transverse humeral ligament, which is over here. 00:01:09And the anterior deltoid, which is running over the top here. 00:01:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:18So a longitudinal image of the same area shows the tendon within the biceps groove, and so here we have the tendon, I'll kind of outline it here. 00:01:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:40Here we have humerus, and this is the biceps groove. 00:01:44So the important thing, I think, to take away here, 00:01:47[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:49Is given that  to take away here, 00:01:47[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:49Is given that we're discussing echogenicity, we're talking about how bright the images are. 00:01:55And so we can see that the bone, 00:01:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:00Is, 00:02:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:03Pretty bright here and that that same bone, it's pretty bright here. 00:02:09And we can see that the biceps tendon is pretty bright, and we can see that the biceps tendon lying on top of that bone is pretty bright. 00:02:20And then we compare that to the deltoid here, which is dark, and we compare that right here, it's dark. 00:02:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:30[INAUDIBLE] of  dark. 00:02:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:30[INAUDIBLE] of slides here, 00:02:32[BLANK_AUDIO]  8.5 Strengths and Limitations of MSK USEffects00:00:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:02So lecture five, musculoskeletal ultrasound, summary of indications and limitations. 00:00:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:11So our objectives for this lecture are to describe, in general, which structures tend to image hyperechoic, hypoechoic, and anechoic. 00:00:20So which structures tend to be brighter and which tend to be darker? 00:00:25And then we want to be able to summarize indications for musculoskeletal ultrasound, and finally identify limitations of musculoskeletal ultrasound. 00:00:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:38Imaging characteristics of ultrasound, normal and abnormal findings, I'd suggest you review your McKinnis book table 6.1. 00:00:47  normal and abnormal findings, I'd suggest you review your McKinnis book table 6.1. 00:00:47Cortical bone, tendons, ligaments, and nerves are hyperechoic relative to their surrounding tissue. 00:00:53And muscle, bursa, and hyaline cartilage or hypoechoic relative to their surrounding tissue, while cysts are anechoic, they're very dark. 00:01:03So have a general idea that cortical bones, tendon, ligament, nerve are generally brighter relative to the surrounding tissue. 00:01:12And have a general idea that muscle, bursa, hyaline cartilage tend to be darker, along with cysts. 00:01:20[BLANK_AUDIO]  9.1 Review of SystemsEffects00:00:00[MUSIC] 00:00:09Okay, so lecture 9.1, review of systems. 00:00:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:20So our objectives for this series of lectures includes describing how the review of systems differs from a systems review. 00:00:30Describing strategies for determining whether a yes and answer to any checklist item is flagged and warrants physician contact. 00:00:38And then number 3 is you should be able to describe strategies to integrate the review of systems checklists efficiently into a patient examination scheme. 00:00:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:53Review of systems, the review of systems provides information about all major body systems. 00:00:59And also allows us to discover whether or not the symptoms suggest a need for referral. 00:01:06Finally, we can incorporate a checklist of symptoms associated  or not the symptoms suggest a need for referral. 00:01:06Finally, we can incorporate a checklist of symptoms associated with each body system to identify any unusual symptoms. 00:01:14So the systematic review of each body system provided by the review of systems can reveal symptoms related to the reason the patient is coming to see the physical therapist. 00:01:26For example, in a patient being seen for back and leg symptoms, who also complains of urinary dysfunction or settled DISAStasia. 00:01:35This combination would raise concern about the possible presence of cauda equina syndrome. 00:01:40Equally important, the checklist may identify symptoms that are unrelated to the patient's chief presenting complaint. 00:01:47But may be associated with one or more existing comorbid conditions, a disease, or adverse drug reactions. 00:01:54Detecting these symptoms would prompt contact with the appropriate healthcare provider. 00:01:59[  or ill appearance, extreme age, young or old, purpura or petechia, generalized or musculoskeletal pain. 00:05:30Immunocompromised patients, lymphadenopathy commonly offending drugs or non healing chronic lesions, chronic irregular and evolving lesions greater than six millimetres or oral lesions. 00:05:41You should communicate that along with the pertinent history, vitals and pertinent physical findings with the referring physician.  . 00:01:54Detecting these symptoms would prompt contact with the appropriate healthcare provider. 00:01:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:04So the review of systems is something we don't want to confuse with a systems review. 00:02:09The systems review is a hands on procedure. 00:02:13The review of systems does not require hands on. 00:02:15The goal is a brief examination of cardiopulmonary status, musculoskeletal, integumentary, and neuromuscular systems. 00:02:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:29So, review of systems, and here I refer you to Box 9.1, the initial review of systems screening in your Boissonnault. 00:02:38The review of systems can be included in a health history questionnaire provided to patients when they enter your clinic. 00:02:44If a yes is  be included in a health history questionnaire provided to patients when they enter your clinic. 00:02:44If a yes is marked by a patient, does that mean it's truly a red flag? 00:02:49So a significant challenge for the physical therapist is deciding whether a positive response. 9.10 Other Systems00:00:01Review of symptoms from other systems nervous, endocrine and integumentary. 00:00:07This is Lecture 9.10. 00:00:10By the end of this lecture, you should be able to describe components of the nervous endocrine and integumentary systems review checklists. 00:00:19You should be able to identify red flags for the integumentary system that may warrant referral. 00:00:26We should also be able to describe common symptoms of psychological disorders from the psychological systems review checklist. 00:00:33Finally, you should be able to identify symptoms that raise suspicion of underlying disorder from  systems review checklist. 00:00:33Finally, you should be able to identify symptoms that raise suspicion of underlying disorder from the musculoskeletal systems review. 00:00:39And describe how to use the review of systems checklist, including based on medical history, and incorporating into follow up visits. 00:00:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:53Please take time to review box 9.1 in your textbook. 00:00:57Use the entire body gram and note the location of any symptoms. 00:01:00Also investigate the onset of symptoms. 00:01:04Starting with an initial neurological screen consisting of questions during the patient interview, continue with the upper and lower quarter screens. 00:01:13From box 9.1, numbness, tingling, weakness, tremors, seizure, vision changes, sexual difficulties, hearing problems, difficulty swallowing, urinary incontinence, vomiting without nausea and dizziness should , vision changes, sexual difficulties, hearing problems, difficulty swallowing, urinary incontinence, vomiting without nausea and dizziness should all be assessed. 00:01:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:33The endocrine systems checklist, please refer to box 9.11 in your textbook. 00:01:38Note that endocrine disorders may present with a variety of symptoms. 00:01:42Be aware of atypical symptom patterns, insidious onset, random appearance of symptoms, etc. 00:01:50Most of these symptoms would be picked up during the patient history. 00:01:54An atypical symptom pattern, for example, insidious onset, symptoms that come and go for no apparent mechanical reason, no consistent time of day, those random symptoms may raise the suspicion that the endocrine system is involved. 00:02:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:15The integumentary systems checklist, please refer to 02:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:15The integumentary systems checklist, please refer to box 9.12 in your textbook. 00:02:23Patient history questions may include information about skin, hair, nails, any new or unexplained or unusual changes in those areas. 00:02:34Try and diagram wounds, abrasions, and bruises as you ask the patient about their symptoms. 00:02:39During the physical examination, follow up using the body the body diagram. 00:02:45Even though many skin disorders are self limiting, almost any skin condition can be extremely distressing for an individual. 00:02:52Not only is a large portion of the skin clearly visible so that all can see any abnormality, but the skin is also an extremely sensitive organ and its disorders invoke a wide range of symptoms. 00:03:04However, in addition to minor self-limiting conditions, the skin serves as a bar  symptoms. 00:03:04However, in addition to minor self-limiting conditions, the skin serves as a barometer for overall health because it often exhibits changes occurring in response to serious underlying systemic problems. 00:03:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:18Follow-up questions for the integumentary system include the onset and progression of skin changes. 00:03:28What exacerbates or relieves the problem, if anything? 00:03:31How has it changed over time? 00:03:33Are there any associated symptoms? 00:03:36The onset and progression of the skin change should be noted. 00:03:40Anything the patient believes may trigger, exacerbate, or relieve the problem should be noted. 00:03:45Inquire about how it may have changed since it was first noticed and all associated symptoms, such as itching, fatigue, and so on. 00:03:53[BLANK_  noticed and all associated symptoms, such as itching, fatigue, and so on. 00:03:53[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:03:57Additional integumentary follow-up questions regarding skin complaints. 00:04:05Inquire about the presence of dryness or itchiness. 00:04:09Are there any new sores, rashes or lumps, any new odor or changes in perspiration? 00:04:15Any changes in warts, moles or lesions that bleed and do not heal? 00:04:19Any change in skin color or texture. 00:04:22Note that there are many medications which can affect the skin. 00:04:25When a patient has a skin complaint, it's important to include a wide range of other integumentary symptoms in the review of symptoms. 00:04:33Sorry, in the review of systems. 00:04:35For instance, ask the patient about the :04:33Sorry, in the review of systems. 00:04:35For instance, ask the patient about the following, dryness, pruritus, sores, rashes, lumps, unusual odor or perspiration, changes in warts or moles. 00:04:45Lesions that bleed and don't heal, or areas of chronic irritation. 00:04:48Establish whether the patient has noticed any changes in the skin's coloration or texture. 00:04:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:02Red flags associated with the integumentary system. 00:05:05So if you notice integumentary systems that seem worrisome, right? 00:05:13Such as presence of new sores, rashes, or lumps, for example, and those are accompanied by fever or ill appearance, extreme age, young or old, purpura or petechia, generalized or musculoske 9.2 General Health Screening and Red Flags00:00:00So, this is presentation 9.2, General Health Screening and Red Flags. 00:00:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:11Our objectives for this presentation are to be able to define the General Health screening tool. 00:00:17Describe strategies for following up on fatigue related General Health screening questions which are marked yes. 00:00:24Identify red flag findings, those that warrant physician contact, and those associated with fatigue. 00:00:30And finally, we should be able to describe strategies for following up on malaise-related General Health screening questions which are marked yes. 00:00:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:44General Health screening, first I'd refer you to your textbook and box 9.2. 00:00:50And the General Health screening can be useful for a first line of medical screening  box 9.2. 00:00:50And the General Health screening can be useful for a first line of medical screening. 00:00:56We can perform a broad screen of organ systems and systemic disorders. 00:01:00If all responses are marked no, a PT then can be relatively comfortable treating the patient. 00:01:07If a pain pattern is also unremarkable, the PT can also be pretty comfortable treating that patient. 00:01:14The first seven items found in box 9.1 along the left column, along with malaise and mentation changes, are complaints that can result from diseases of a number of different body systems. 00:01:26Multi-system disorders, systemic illnesses, and adverse drug reactions. 00:01:31Some of these symptoms, for example fatigue and malaise, are extremely vague but may be the initial manifestations of a very serious underlying illness. 00:01:40[BLANK_AUDIO  vague but may be the initial manifestations of a very serious underlying illness. 00:01:40[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:47So just as we reviewed in the last lecture, if there are yes responses, it's then up to you to determine if that complaint is new, different, or unusual for the patient. 00:01:58Is there an explanation for the change that would decrease your concern? 00:02:01Has the patient spoken about this with their physician? 00:02:04And if the physician has been spoken with, has the problem become worse since the time the physician became aware of it? 00:02:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:18So additional required information about fatigue. 00:02:21Some of the questions you might ask the patient could include when did your fatigue begin? 00:02:27Was it gradual onset? 00:02:29Have you noticed other unusual symptoms like nausea  begin? 00:02:27Was it gradual onset? 00:02:29Have you noticed other unusual symptoms like nausea, fever, or loss of weight, bilateral joint pain, or early morning stiffness? 00:02:38The presence of the above symptoms could suggest malignancy, infection, or even rheumatic disorder.  9.3 Weight Loss and Nausea00:00:00So lecture three, Review of Symptoms, Weight Loss, and Nausea. 00:00:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:09So the objectives for this lecture, by the end you should be able to describe strategies for following up on fever, chills, and sweats related to general health screening questions. 00:00:19You should be able to identify red flag findings associated with fever, chills, and sweats. 00:00:24You should be able to describe strategies for following up on unexplained weight change from the general health screening questions. 00:00:32You should be able to identify red flag findings associated with involuntary weight loss. 00:00:37And describe strategies for following up on nausea and vomiting, and the general health screening questions which are marked yes. 00:00:43Finally, you should be able to identify red flag findings associated with nausea and vomiting  are marked yes. 00:00:43Finally, you should be able to identify red flag findings associated with nausea and vomiting. 00:00:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:58Fever, Chills, and Sweats. 00:01:01These are generally representative of systemic illnesses such as infections, cancers, and rheumatoid arthritis. 00:01:07If fever is checked as yes on a questionnaire, then you should follow up with additional questions, such as are you currently suffering from the flu? 00:01:16Could you have a sinus or other kind of infection?  9.4 Strategies in Response to the General Health Screening00:00:01Lecture 9 for strategies in response to the general health screening 00:00:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:09.Objectives, by the end of this lecture you should be able to describe strategies for following up on paresthesia numbness, or weakness-related general health screening questions. 00:00:23You should be able to identify red flag findings, those that weren't physician contact associated with paresthesia, numbness or weakness. 00:00:32You should describe strategies for following up on dizziness and lightheadedness, you should be able to identify red flag findings that weren't physician contact associated with dizziness and lightheadedness. 00:00:44You should be able to describe strategies for following up on changes in mental status. 00:00:48And finally, you should be able to identify red flag findings that warrant  on changes in mental status. 00:00:48And finally, you should be able to identify red flag findings that warrant physician contact associated with change in mental status. 00:00:55[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:02Paresthesia, numbness, or weakness. 00:01:05Other conditions besides neurological disorders can present as paresthesia, numbness or weakness, so you might ask a patient have you experienced any changes in sensation or strength? 00:01:17If they have are those changes associated with specific activities, what's the distribution of the numbness or weakness, are there any associated balance deficits? 00:01:27Any changes in vision, taste, smell, or hearing.  9.5 Upper Body SymptomsEffects00:00:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:02Lecture 9.5, we're going to begin to talk about upper body symptoms. 00:00:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:11By the end of the lecture, you should be able to describe strategies for following up on dyspnea, palpitations, syncope, cardiovascular related pain. 00:00:21And you should be able to identify red flag findings associated with chest pain or chest pressure. 00:00:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:33The general health checklist I'd like you to look at box 9.1 and 9.6 as well as table 9.2 in your textbook. 00:00:41And then note the overlap between cardiovascular, peripheral vascular and pulmonary systems. 00:00:47Some items listed in box 9.1, including dyspnea , peripheral vascular and pulmonary systems. 00:00:47Some items listed in box 9.1, including dyspnea, cough and palpitations, overlap with the checklist for the cardiovascular peripheral vascular and pulmonary systems. 00:00:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:08Dyspnea is the subjective sensation of difficulty breathing. 00:01:12This could be related to activity, exertion or body position. 00:01:17You might ask your patient when did the shortness of breath begin? 00:01:19Was the onset sudden or did it occur over time? 00:01:23Did you wake suddenly at night with shortness of breath? 00:01:25Is the shortness of breath constant? 00:01:28Does your shortness of breath occur with exertion? 00:01:31Does it occur at rest, or does it occur in certain positions? 00:01:35Dysp 01:31Does it occur at rest, or does it occur in certain positions? 00:01:35Dyspnea, or shortness of breath, has many causes including cardiac or pulmonary disease, as well as anxiety, obesity, and anemia. 00:01:45Patients with a cardiac cause may also complain of increased symptoms with exertion and symptoms or dyspnea that wake them up at night and are relieved by sitting up. 00:01:54[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:58PND, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, is one of the early signs of heart failure and therefore is more specific for cardiac disease. 00:02:08Dyspnea caused by cardiac disease results most commonly from left ventricular dysfunction and or valvular disease. 00:02:16Typically, difficulty with breathing would be associated with activity or exertion. 00:02:21So if you ask about dysp , difficulty with breathing would be associated with activity or exertion. 00:02:21So if you ask about dyspnea only in this context, patients may not volunteer that they get short of breath when they lie down. 00:02:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:36Palpitations are an awareness of forceful rapid or irregular beating of the heart. 00:02:41Occasional palpitations occur in most of the population. 00:02:44Palpitations may be described as uncomfortable sensations in the chest and they may be associated with arrhythmias. 00:02:51Your patient may describe palpitations as fluttering, jumping, pounding, irregularity, or feeling like their heart is skipping a beat. 00:03:01You should ask your patient about their frequency, the duration, and any associated symptoms. 00:03:06You should also ask your patient about any history of heart disease, myocard  and any associated symptoms. 00:03:06You should also ask your patient about any history of heart disease, myocardial infarction, heart attack, or valvular heart disease. 00:03:15Occasional palpitations occur physiologically and the majority of the population. 00:03:21Or in some people as a result of other non cardiac conditions such as anxiety, panic attacks, somatization, exercise, hyperthyroidism and anemia. 00:03:30Palpitations can also occur with valvular heart disease, increased or decreased stroke volume, and during arrhythmias. 00:03:40Ask your patient about the frequency and duration of the palpitations, as well as the presence of any associated symptoms, such as a loss of consciousness, lightheadedness, chest pain, or pressure. 00:03:52Or shortness of breath, nausea, or vomiting. 00:03:56Occasionally, . 00:03:52Or shortness of breath, nausea, or vomiting. 00:03:56Occasionally, young healthy patients may have frequent PVCs that are benign in nature but warrant investigation to rule out serious causes.

objectives for this lecture. 00:00:11By the end, you should be able to describe strategies for following up on cough-related general health screening questions. 00:00:18Identify potential danger signs associated with the history of cough. 00:00:23Identify items included in the pulmonary systems checklist. 00:00:27Describe strategies for following up on respiratory sounds. 00:00:31Identify items included in the hematological systems checklist. 00:00:35And describe important hematological signs and symptoms to be aware of, especially if checklist items are worrisome. 00:00:40[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:46So the presence of a cough may trigger concerns regarding pulmonary system or cardiovascular system pathology. 00:00  00:00:46So the presence of a cough may trigger concerns regarding pulmonary system or cardiovascular system pathology. 00:00:54A cough at night could be associated with heart failure or calcium channel blockers. 00:00:59You should inquire whether there's history of cigarette smoking, allergies, or even post-nasal drip associated with the cough. 00:01:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:08So the presentation of a cough should trigger concern about the pulmonary system, but also with disorders of the cardiovascular system. 00:01:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:19The cough may be associated with very serious disorders such as asthma, pneumonia, cancer, or even heart failure. 00:01:26However, keep in mind that a cough is an extremely common and potentially nonspecific complaint. 00:01:33So how do we determine how serious the cough is clinically? 00:01:36[BLANK  00:01:33So how do we determine how serious the cough is clinically? 00:01:36[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:42Follow-up questions you might ask a patient who presents with a cough include, how long have you had the cough? 00:01:48What do you think the cause is? 00:01:50Is your cough constant? 00:01:52Is it related or does it change with your position or posture? 00:01:56Is it a productive cough? 00:01:57And so, what's the color of the sputum? 00:02:00Is your cough painful? 00:02:02You should also assess whether symptoms on the general health checklist are associated with the cough. 00:02:07[BLANK_AUDIO]  9.7 Upper Gastrointestinal Symptoms00:00:01Lecture 9.7, the upper gastrointestinal symptoms. 00:00:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:09So by the end of this lecture, you should be able to, 00:00:13[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:15Describe strategies for follow-up questions with patients who have difficulty swallowing. 00:00:20Describe strategies for follow-up questions with patients who suffer from dyspepsia. 00:00:26Identify additional physical examination strategies for a patient who presents with a worrisome history of dyspepsia. 00:00:34Identify important questions to ask your patient regarding upper GI bowel function. 00:00:39And define melena and acholic stool and pathologies that may be associated with these findings. 00:00:44[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:49So I  be associated with these findings. 00:00:44[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:49So I'd like you to take a look at Box 9.8 in your textbook. 00:00:53Dysphasia can sometimes be associated with nausea and vomiting. 00:00:57Dysphasia is difficulty swallowing and represents a loss of muscle control or an obstruction. 00:01:05Causes of muscle incoordination can include underlying disorders such as, myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, Parkinson's, dermatomyositis or poliomyelitis. 00:01:18Mechanical obstructions can include things like underlying causes such as cancer, peptic stricture secondary to gastroesophageal reflux disease or esophageal rings. 00:01:31Mechanical disorders are usually limited to solid food. 00:01:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01 Mechanical disorders are usually limited to solid food. 00:01:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:35The history is particularly important in these patients because physical examination is really of little value when diagnosing dysphagia. 00:01:44Ask your patient whether they have difficulty swallowing only with liquids or does it also occur with solids, discern whether it is constant or intermittent. 00:01:54Ask your patient about a history of cancer, neuromuscular or autoimmune diseases or GERD. 00:02:00If the patient is elderly, inquire whether there have been frequent bouts of pneumonia or a chronic cough, which might alert you to aspiration as a cause. 00:02:09Ask your patient about any medications that they're currently on. 00:02:12The bisphosphonates a drug class used for treating osteoporosis can cause esophagitis especially if not taken with a full glass of water. 00:  for treating osteoporosis can cause esophagitis especially if not taken with a full glass of water. 00:02:23Ask about habits such as smoking and alcohol intake because cancers of the head and neck are more common in individuals with a history of tobacco and/or alcohol use or abuse. 00:02:33[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:40In your textbook, please take a look at Table 9.3.  9.8 Lower Gastrointestinal Symptoms00:00:01Lecture 9.8 covers lower gastrointestinal symptoms. 00:00:09By the end of the lecture, you should be able to identify the important components of lower GI screening to be able to define hematochezia and describe follow up questions to ask a patient Who describes symptoms consistent with hematochezia. 00:00:24Describe follow-up questions related to constipation and describe follow-up questions related to diarrhea. 00:00:29[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:36Lower gastrointestinal screening for symptoms. 00:00:39Take a look at Box 9.8 in your textbook. 00:00:42The screening of the lower gastrointestinal tract is based on questions about bowel function including the color of stools the shape and the caliber of stools constipation diarrhea difficulty initiating a bowel movement and incontinence. 00:00:56[BLANK_AUD  stools constipation diarrhea difficulty initiating a bowel movement and incontinence. 00:00:56[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:01Hematochezia is the passage of bright red blood and stools, and if that's present, then you should ask your patient, how long has this been occurring? 00:01:10Is there any history of GI bleeding? 00:01:13Are there other symptoms associated with this, such as difficulty initiating bowel movements, or do they feel lightheaded? 00:01:20Is blood only in the stool or is there blood in the absence of stool? 00:01:25Make sure and check your patient's vital signs.  9.9 Genitourinary Symptoms00:00:01Lecture 9.9, Genitourinary Symptoms. 00:00:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:08So by the end of this lecture, you should be able to describe how the color of urine can be indicative of pathology. 00:00:14You should be able to define hematuria, dysuria, nocturia, and polyuria. 00:00:21Identify follow up questions given a situation in which you suspect your patient may be suffering from hematuria, dysuria, nocturia, or polyuria. 00:00:30You should be able to identify genitourinary system red flag signs and identify red flag signs associated with reproductive function 00:00:37[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:44Please refer to box 9.9 in your textbook, Genitourinary System Checklist. 00:00: :44Please refer to box 9.9 in your textbook, Genitourinary System Checklist. 00:00:51Color of urine may be an indicator of pathology. 00:00:56A dark color may be associated with hepatic or biliary obstruction or acute rhabdomyolysis. 00:01:03Hematuria, blood in the urine can be a sign of many different diseases in the urinary tract. 00:01:09Urine may also be read from ingesting vegetable dyes, beets, or certain medications like Pyridium. 00:01:17Be aware that over the lifespan, storage, function, and bladder outlet obstruction for both genders varies.
