3.1 Principles of RadiologyEffects00:00:00[MUSIC] 00:00:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:09So this is the first lecture, Principles of Radiology. 00:00:16And in this lecture we'll be discussing general principles and radiology. 00:00:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:27So the objectives here are to describe why clinicians need to view diagnostic images. 00:00:34Describe radiology and musculoskeletal imaging. 00:00:37And then summarize the evolution of imaging From Wilhelm Rontgen in 1895 through today, so a lot of this first lecture is going to include some history. 00:00:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:54So why do we need diagnostic imaging? 00:00:59Well, the PT education provides a foundation for understanding imaging and the PT education provides a foundation for ? 00:00:59Well, the PT education provides a foundation for understanding imaging and the PT education provides a foundation for being able to associate our clinical findings with findings on imaging. 00:01:15[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:17So if physicians already have access to ordering and interpreting imaging, then why would physical therapists need any kind of diagnostic imaging education? 00:01:30Well as we just stated, PTs receive education in basic sciences like anatomy. 00:01:37And we also have an education that's clinical, and we have an applied science education. 00:01:45And so we should have the confidence and the tools to be able to communicate effectively with radiologists to get additional information from looking at images on their own. 00:01:58So, imaging provides a more comprehensive evaluation. 00:02:03And so, when you're examining a patient, that patient history and the physical findings can be supplemented by imaging .5 minutes of processing, today, it takes less than a second. 00:09:13In 1984, MRI was approved for clinical use. 00:09:18Right here, in the 1990s, functional MRI changed the way we can view the chemical composition of the brain. 00:09:30And after that charged-coupled devices began to translate light to images, and we were able to convert film-based to digital imaging. 00:09:42And then picture archiving and communication systems, PACS, allowed the storage and the viewing and filing and transmission of images so that. 00:09:52A whole network of clinicians could have immediate access to an image. 00:09:57Computer-assisted diagnostics and pattern recognitions 00:10:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:04Began to pick up, and those are still being developed today. 00:10:07But humans are still better at identifying harmful  to pick up, and those are still being developed today. 00:10:07But humans are still better at identifying harmful non-normal kinds of images. 00:10:14But things like image-guided surgery continue to progress and surgical robotics, molecular imaging, PET-CT and PET MRI. 00:10:22PET stands for positron emission. 00:10:25In these kinds of developments enable more individualized approaches to different treatments. 00:10:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:34So medical images that were stored on film really have acquired an incredible amount of space for storage in a facility and in addition, a film could only be at one location at any time. 00:10:47And so this meant that there were times when a film might be needed to help determine the care for a patient, but that film may not be available at that location. 00:10:57So now studies are maintained on servers where images can  that film may not be available at that location. 00:10:57So now studies are maintained on servers where images can be archive. 00:11:02They can be transmitted or communicated to others, and they can be stored, and this system is called PACS, picture, archiving, communications, and storage. 00:11:12[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com 02:03And so, when you're examining a patient, that patient history and the physical findings can be supplemented by imaging. 00:02:11When that's necessary to provide a more thorough understanding of any kind of underlying pathological process. 00:02:19But it can also help illuminate maybe the absence of some sort of underlying process that you might have thought was going on but isn't. 00:02:30And finally, a physical therapists could be looking for information from imaging. 00:02:37That's not the same as the kind of information that a physician might be looking for. 00:02:42So we can imagine a case where maybe there's a bony malunion and that may change our treatment goals and our interventions. 00:02:53Know for example, what we may be able to expect in terms of range of motion. 00:02:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:02So what is radiology?  motion. 00:02:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:02So what is radiology? 00:03:04Well, radiology is investigating or exploring the use of radiant energy and where do you active materials to diagnose, treat and prevent disease? 00:03:18So radiology is generally the term interchangeable with diagnostic imaging or medical imaging right. 00:03:26So basically one can be substituted for the other without changing the meaning so these things are all essentially mean the same thing, right? 00:03:36Findings from the radiology report. 00:03:38Findings from diagnostic imaging, results of medical imaging, etc. 00:03:41They all sort of convey the same idea. 00:03:43[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:49So what is musculoskeletal imaging? 00:03:55That is an MSK right there. 00:03:59That culoskeletal imaging? 00:03:55That is an MSK right there. 00:03:59That's a subspecialty of radiology. 00:04:01Looking at the musculoskeletal system, so conventional radiography or X rays. 00:04:07That's usually the first order imaging procedure after the clinical examination when we're looking for suspected musculoskeletal pathology. 00:04:16So if a patient is suspected of having a fracture, it's very likely that the x-ray will be the first choice for imaging. 00:04:25[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:29So in 1895, Willem Roentgen, that's this gentleman right here I was working in his dark laboratory in Germany. 00:04:37And he noticed that a screen that was painted with a fluorescent material and located a few feet away in the same room as a cathode ray tube started to glow  was painted with a fluorescent material and located a few feet away in the same room as a cathode ray tube started to glow. 00:04:50So this screen somewhere over here, if this room was dark, is now glowing and after repeating the experiment. 00:04:58He recognized that the screen was responding to the nearby production of a form of energy that was transmitted invisibly through the room from this cathode ray tube. 00:05:11So here's this cathode ray tube imaginary one over here. 00:05:15But it's transmitting this invisible energy over here to this screen. 00:05:21And he named those rays x-rays using the mathematical symbol x,because x symbolizes something unknown. 00:05:30And it didn't take very long before almost everyone was taking x rays of almost everything that they could think of. 00:05:36[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:39So x-rays  could think of. 00:05:36[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:39So x-rays were used to detect art forgeries and they were used in jewel smuggling, detecting jewel smuggling.creative entrepreneurs sold. 00:05:50X-ray proof underwear and customers at shoe stores could have X-rays taken to the feet inside a new pair of shoes. 00:05:57We can see here. 00:05:59So this is illustrating some x-ray proof clothing here on this lady, and by using the x-ray proof clothing. 00:06:09Apparently, someone wielding an x-ray wouldn't be able to look at your bones, which I guess was important. 00:06:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:21So in the early 1900s, there was an X-ray craze. 00:06:25The X-rays were seen as a miracle cure and they could  an X-ray craze. 00:06:25The X-rays were seen as a miracle cure and they could do things like kill germs and improve beauty. 00:06:32But exposure to radiation had consequences. 00:06:37And by World War I, there was a very popular image of a radiologist, and that image included a gloved or an amputated hand, which was a result of that hand being exposed to x-rays, right? 00:06:52But even as those x-rays became combined to medical settings, they're is still used and coin operated Foot-o-Scopes which were used for looking at feet all the way up until after World War Two. 00:07:06And then in 1957 Pennsylvania became the first state to ban the use of those Foot-o-Scopes. 00:07:13[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:07:14We can see one of those over here Foot :07:13[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:07:14We can see one of those over here Foot-o-Scope. 00:07:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:24So, in the 1910s and 20s, the military was using x-rays to screen for tuberculosis via chest x-rays. 00:07:33The military was also using x-rays to examine bullet wounds and fractures. 00:07:39And military was very active during that time, driving trucks with portable x-ray units. 00:07:47And then we have the development of diagnostic ultrasound and that evolved from sonar technology. 00:07:55And in the 1920s and 30s nuclear medicine development continued and still there wasn't much consideration given to radiation exposure. 00:08:05And in fact, the average age of death around that time for a radiologist was about 56 years old, Marie curie's notebooks  fact, the average age of death around that time for a radiologist was about 56 years old, Marie curie's notebooks are still radioactive today. 00:08:16So in 1945, the detonation of atomic bombs generated more interest in the effects of exposure to radiation. 00:08:25And in the 50s and 60s, effective dose limits began to be talked about and what that meant was that there became this recognition that no dose exists below which the risk of damage does not exist. 00:08:40So, the idea was to keep the dose as low as reasonably achievable right here ALARA as low as reasonably achievable. 00:08:55So in the 1970s computer-heated tomography permitted cross-sectional images. 00:09:01And a single slice of image took around 4.5 minutes of scanning and then 1.5 minutes of processing, today, it takes less than a second. 00:09:13In 1984, MRI was 3.2 Radiation00:00:01So Lecture 3.2, Radiology Equipment. 00:00:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:09The objectives for this lecture are to identify the three things required to produce an X-ray. 00:00:15And number two, describe the terms radiograph, image receptor, radiation, effective dose limits, and sievert. 00:00:27So a radiograph is an X-ray film containing an image of part of a patient's anatomy. 00:00:34And producing a radiograph requires an X-ray source, a patient, and an X-ray film or an image receptor. 00:00:44So it's also referred to as plain film radiograph, standard radiograph, conventional radiograph, and most commonly now as films or X-rays. 00:00:55The standard medical literature language is radiographs. 00:01:00Also, it -rays. 00:00:55The standard medical literature language is radiographs. 00:01:00Also, it's important to remember that hardcopy is film and softcopy is a digital copy of the image. 00:01:11This slide on the right side over here shows a picture of radiant energy in the electromagnetic spectrum from lower frequency radio waves all the way up through higher frequency Gamma waves. 00:01:26And radiology is the branch of medicine concerned with radiant energy and radioactive substances. 00:01:33And those include X-rays and radioactive isotopes along with ionizing radiation. 00:01:40And this also encompasses the application of this information to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases. 00:01:50Radiation is energy transmitted through space or matter. 00:01:54And the shorter the wavelength, the higher the energy of the radiation and the greater the penetrating power. 00:02:01Physicians specializing in radiology  the higher the energy of the radiation and the greater the penetrating power. 00:02:01Physicians specializing in radiology are radiologists, and professional technicians who produce the images are radiographers. 00:02:12Most imaging studies are produced by ionizing radiation, while diagnostic ultrasound and MRI are examples of non-ionizing imaging studies. 00:02:23So diagnostic imaging is the same thing as medical imaging and the same thing as radiology, they're basically interchangeable descriptions. 00:02:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:36What are X-rays? 00:02:38X-rays are ionizing electromagnetic radiation. 00:02:42And this is different than non-ionizing radiation like ultraviolet light, visible light, infrared, microwave, radio and TV radiation. 00:02:51That does not have enough energy to remove electrons from atoms or molecules. 00:02:56X-rays are ionizing electromagnetic radiation.  have enough energy to remove electrons from atoms or molecules. 00:02:56X-rays are ionizing electromagnetic radiation. 00:03:01So again, some non-ionizing sources of electromagnetic fields include cell phones, tablets, radios, older TVs, power lines, electrical wiring, and home appliances. 00:03:14And if we look at this picture here, we can see basically this span moving from non-ionizing radiation on the left, ionizing radiation on the right. 00:03:28And ionizing radiation means that this radiation is going to have the potential to remove electrons from atoms or molecules. 00:03:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:46So non-ionizing radiation is low energy radiation that can cause molecules to vibrate and produce heat like microwave, ovens. 00:03:55Radio waves and visible light are other examples, and for most people, non-ionizing radiation does not pose a risk 55Radio waves and visible light are other examples, and for most people, non-ionizing radiation does not pose a risk to their health. 00:04:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:12The sievert or millisievert is a measure to quantify radiation and measure its impact on people. 00:04:20In high doses, Ionizing radiation can damage cells or organs or even cause death by detaching electrons from atoms or molecules. 00:04:30Which involves the production of ions, and hence the term ionizing radiation. 00:04:34Inappropriate doses used in medical diagnosis and treatment of diseases, ionizing radiation can be helpful, for example combating diseases such as cancer. 00:04:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:53There are no prescribed limits on radiation doses to patients. 00:04:57This means that no amount of radiation is considered too much for a patient when the procedure  to patients. 00:04:57This means that no amount of radiation is considered too much for a patient when the procedure is justified by the health care provider after considering the benefits and the risks. 00:05:08And examination that serves no purpose is inappropriate, no matter how small the radiation dose. 00:05:15Ensuring that the results of earlier imaging are available helps avoid unnecessary exposure to radiation through repeat investigations. 00:05:23And so one of the things to note here, is the natural exposure to radiation, for example from the air or from traveling in an airplane. 00:05:34And compare that to the magnitude of radiation exposure and, for example, a single chest X-ray which is relatively small. 00:05:43And a chest CT scan, a single scan which is orders of magnitude larger in terms of radiation exposure. 00:05:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:56So this term over here  radiation exposure. 00:05:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:56So this term over here, ALARA, stands for As Low As Reasonably Achievable. 00:06:02And I included this slide to provide additional examples of radiation exposure. 00:06:08And so we can see the naturally occurring yearly exposure here is 3 milli sieverts and average US background radiation is 3.6. 00:06:18Again, we compare that to a chest CT here of 5 to 8, and compare that again to an abdominal CT 5 to 10 millisieverts. 00:06:28So a CT of the abdomen with a dose of 10 millisieverts is approximately equivalent to 500 chest X-rays, or three years of average US background radiation. 00:06:40[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com 3.3 Production of XRAYS00:00:02Welcome to lecture 3.3, and this lecture is The Production of X-Rays. 00:00:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:14The objectives of this lecture are to describe how x-rays are produced. 00:00:19Describe radio density and how it is depicted in a radiograph, describe the effect of thickness and orientation on a radiograph, and identify four factors that impact image quality. 00:00:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:36How are x-rays produced? 00:00:38So to produce x-rays we have to have a source of electrons, and then we have to have a force to move them. 00:00:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:50And finally you have to have something to stop the movement of those electrons quickly, and so that leads us right into :50And finally you have to have something to stop the movement of those electrons quickly, and so that leads us right into our next slide. 00:01:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:04So, we have an x-ray tube over here and we have the x-rays traveling here and we have the image receptor right here. 00:01:17The x-rays are produced in the tube and they travel out and pass through the patient. 00:01:24Where they're attenuated to different degrees depending on the tissue that those electrons pass through. 00:01:31The x-ray beam that emerges from the other side of the patient called the remnant radiation is intercepted by an image receptor. 00:01:40The information that the receptor is processed by different methods depending on the type of receptor and following that an image is produced, which is called a radiograph. 00:01:50[BLANK_AUDIO]  00:09:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:16And then number 4 is bone, and we can see the bony components of the proximal femur and the pelvis and sacrum and the spine. 00:09:27And this picture, we can really see how radio dense or bright bone is. 00:09:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:40So this slide depicts media and heavy metals in imaging. 00:09:46And if we look over here first on the left, The lower GI dual contrast medium examination is depicted here. 00:09:54And this normal colon is coated inside with barium and extended with air and so that's what the dual refers to, the barium and the air. 00:10:05The bright white outline caused by the medium allows detailed visualization of the structures, which wouldn't normally be visible on plain radiographs. 00:10:14And the image  detailed visualization of the structures, which wouldn't normally be visible on plain radiographs. 00:10:14And the image on the right here, this is a total hip replacement or a total hip arthroplasty. 00:10:22The metals used in the prosthetic of this joint, they absorb the x-rays and cast a solid white image on the radiograph, very radio dense. 00:10:32So any anatomic structures behind the metal or the prosthesis are obscured. 00:10:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:42So in this slide we'll go over some terms for patient positioning and x-ray projection. 00:10:48So the position is how the patient is placed during the radiographic exam, and examples include supine, prone, sideline, recumbent, those are standard. 00:10:59We also have erect or weight bearing, and that indicates that the joints are under the effect of . 00:10:59We also have erect or weight bearing, and that indicates that the joints are under the effect of gravity, or under load. 00:11:06The projection is what direction the x-ray travels in in relation to the patient's body and so we have anterior posterior oblique and lateral 00:11:18[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:25So these are some examples of oblique views. 00:11:29And when these images are viewed, they can either be done in light boxes or digitally using a monitor. 00:11:36And the image is usually viewed with the image in the anatomical position. 00:11:41In other words, if you have an anterior posterior image of the knee, you want to have the image position so that it looks like the patient is standing in front of you. 00:11:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:55So in this slide we'll  you. 00:11:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:55So in this slide we'll talk about some basic radiographic terminology again. 00:12:00So position identifies the patient's position in two ways, in reference to the general body position and in reference to specific positions describing which body part is closest to the image receptor. 00:12:16Decubitus, here the patient may be lying prone supine all on one side. 00:12:23Usually these positions are used to detect air fluid levels in the chest and abdomen. 00:12:28Radiographs can be made with the patient upright and [UNKNOWN] in standing position. 00:12:33And rectal wing bearing/u can establish that joints were gravity and or wing bearing/u independent. 00:12:40And usually if a joint is wing bearing, this is marked on the radiograph. 00:12:45[BLANK_AUD  if a joint is wing bearing, this is marked on the radiograph. 00:12:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:48And so in position starting with A, right, we have general positions including upright, seated, supine, prone, erect, recumbent and Trendelenburg. 00:13:00And then specific describing which body part is closest to the image receptor as I mentioned earlier, and then decubitus is basically our lying positions. 00:13:10For more on this you can see table 1.5 and figure 1.16 in your McKinnis text. 00:13:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:24So as I mentioned earlier, it's important to always view the radiographs as if viewing the patient and the anatomic position, right? 00:13:33So the radiographs are viewed as if the patient we're standing right in front of the viewer, in the 13:33So the radiographs are viewed as if the patient we're standing right in front of the viewer, in the anatomic position. 00:13:38This AP radiograph of the knee is being viewed properly. 00:13:42The R marker and we can see that right here, tells us this is the patient's right leg. 00:13:50So the radiograph is viewed with the fibula to the viewer's left hand side. 00:13:56The small letters below the R are the technician's initials. 00:14:02The pathology indicated in the circle is an osteogenic sarcoma. 00:14:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:17Image quality, density is the amount of blackening on an image, and contrast is the difference between the adjacent image densities. 00:14:29Detail refers to the geometric sharpness or the accuracy of the lines on the radiograph for example the :14:29Detail refers to the geometric sharpness or the accuracy of the lines on the radiograph for example the resolution, the definition or the sharpness. 00:14:39Distortion refers to the difference between the actual object and the recorded images. 00:14:46So density and contrast are photographic properties that control visibility, detail and distortion are geometric properties that control clarity. 00:14:58[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com  that an image is produced, which is called a radiograph. 00:01:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:56Understanding the Image, radio density is determined by the composition and thickness of an object. 00:02:03And radio density affects the amount of radiation an object absorbs from the X ray. 00:02:12Radioopaque means that an object is not easily penetrated by x-rays. 00:02:19The representation of the object is white because x-rays do not reach the receptor. 00:02:24Examples include things like heavy metals or fillings and teeth, or contrast media such as barium sulfate. 00:02:33Radiolucent material is easily penetrated by x-rays. 00:02:37Most of the x-rays will reach the receptors so the radio graphic representation of the object is dark, air is an example. 00:02:46When describing bone, radio loosen areas have  representation of the object is dark, air is an example. 00:02:46When describing bone, radio loosen areas have decreased radio density due to abnormal processes such as osteoporotic bone or osteolytic tumors or infections. 00:03:00And in this image on the top right here we can see that objects that are more radiolucent are near the top such as air. 00:03:11And objects that are more radio-dense are near the bottom, such as metal. 00:03:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:31Thickness and orientation of an object will also affect the image. 00:03:37Radiographic density as a function of thickness of the object will vary. 00:03:45So pretend the objects being radiographed are a series of bone slices, each progressively thicker in a stepwise fashion. 00:03:52Now look at the developed image, it also has a step  progressively thicker in a stepwise fashion. 00:03:52Now look at the developed image, it also has a stepwise increase in lighter shades Gray. 00:03:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:03The finished slice of bone on the left image is the least radio dense and the thickest slice on the far right is the most radio dense. 00:04:15The point here is that the thicker any object is, the greater amount of radiation it will absorb compared to a thinner object or a thinner portion of the same object. 00:04:25[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:28Now, if we look at images A through F over here. 00:04:32[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:04:34This is a wedge of wood radiographed from three different angles and it produces three distinctly different radiographic shape outlines. 00:04:43With varying radiographic densities depending on how  and it produces three distinctly different radiographic shape outlines. 00:04:43With varying radiographic densities depending on how much thickness of wood the beam passes through 00:04:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:59This effect is seen also in the bottom right here with this tube. 00:05:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:12For a radiograph to be useful, more than one projection is required. 00:05:17A single image only provides information in two dimensions, length and width. 00:05:22So that third dimension depth is achieved through a second radiograph performed at a 90 degree angle to the first one. 00:05:31Two images taken at right angles to each other provide information on length, width, and depth. 00:05:38And we can see that over here with this image of a finger 00:05:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05  see that over here with this image of a finger 00:05:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:49This slide is also meant to discuss the importance of having multiple images. 00:05:54For A over here, the lateral projection of the cervical spine best demonstrates the facet joints indicated by the point of the pen. 00:06:05So you can find the facet joint on the corresponding lateral radiograph on C right here. 00:06:12The facet joint space images as a dark diagonal line or arrow. 00:06:17Again, that dark diagonal line is dark because it's not as dense as the bone. 00:06:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:27In B, 00:06:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:31The oblique projection of the cervical spine best demonstrates the intervertebral foramina. 00:06:37The tip of the pen  projection of the cervical spine best demonstrates the intervertebral foramina. 00:06:37The tip of the pen is at the C5-6 right intervertebral foramen, look at the corresponding radiograph in D. 00:06:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:47The intervertebral forum in images as a dark oval, and that's right here. 00:06:52Again, it's dark because it's less dense than the surrounding tissue and bone. 00:06:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:02So we have a two radiograph minimum, when you want to use these radiographs to provide information about the dimension of the structure and so that requires to radiographs. 00:07:14This will also allow us to locate lesions or foreign bodies and determine alignment of fractures. 00:07:21So the most common projections for the skeleton are the AP, lateral and ob  determine alignment of fractures. 00:07:21So the most common projections for the skeleton are the AP, lateral and oblique projections. 00:07:27Oblique projections may be included during joint examinations or examinations where the surface topography is more complex. 00:07:36[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:39So this slide apparently needs a slide title, we'll call it The 4. 00:07:47[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:50Major radio densities. 00:07:54[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:58And those are depicted in this image and in number 1 over here. 00:08:05Air can be seen in the descending colon and also in the center of the pelvis, and this is the typical speckled look of feces mixed with gas right there. 00:08:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:18If we look  with gas right there. 00:08:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:18If we look at number 2, this is fat seen as this sort of dark streak either side there. 00:08:28And that's fatty layer next to the peritoneum and the abdominal wall and that stripe is the fold of the fat layer as it turns posteriorly towards the patient's back. 00:08:42Now in number 3 over here, what we can see is water and muscles and soft tissue share the same density as water. 00:08:52And many water density organs, vessels, and muscles comprise the shades of gray in this radiograph. 00:09:00The arrow points to the so as muscle as it extends along the border of the lumbar spine. 00:09:08So right in here. 00:09:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:16And then number 4 is bone, and 3.4 Practice Acts and Deciding Whether to Image00:00:01Hi, and welcome to lecture 3.4. 00:00:04This is an introduction to practice acts and deciding whether or not to image. 00:00:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:11So our objectives here are to describe state practice regulation, with specific regard to how the scope of practice is regulated both geographically and legislatively. 00:00:22Provide two reasons why a physical therapist might request imaging. 00:00:27Define the American College of Rheumatology, the ACR, Appropriateness Criteria. 00:00:33And describe how the x-rays interact with the patient, and the advantages and disadvantages of x-ray film versus digital imaging technologies. 00:00:43[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:46Referring patients for imaging. 00:00:49So the legal scope of practice AUDIO] 00:00:46Referring patients for imaging. 00:00:49So the legal scope of practice in terms of referring patients is regulated by each United States jurisdiction through PT practice acts. 00:01:00And I have links on here to the APTA federal special interest group and the Academy of Orthopedic Physical Therapy special interest group for imaging. 00:01:11In Australia, the United Kingdom, a portion of Canadian provinces and Norway, physical therapists have imaging referral privileges and imaging is standard within physical therapy practice. 00:01:26Colorado, Utah, Wisconsin, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Washington DC, New Jersey, Maryland and Arizona are states that expressly allow physical therapy imaging referral. 00:01:41There are a growing number of areas of the United States that are gaining referral privileges. 00:01:47Practice acts approach referral for imaging privileges with language that's categorized as specifically inclusive, interpretable to allow referral, silent, or 08:42If you're deciding to refer the patient, you've decided that the patient's condition warrants referral to another provider. 00:08:50If you're deciding to treat and refer, this means management of a portion of this patient's presentation is within the scope of PT practice. 00:08:58However, the patient may need or benefit from the services of another provider. 00:09:04And it may be for the same condition or a condition that's occurring along with this one but is different. 00:09:12[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:17When you're considering referring a patient for imaging, one of the things to keep in mind is the financial implications. 00:09:25And looking at this table, we can see that, first of all, conventional radiographs, we can imagine around $450. 00:09:34A CT scan, $2,000, MRI, $3,500, bone scan 450. 00:09:34A CT scan, $2,000, MRI, $3,500, bone scan, $1,400. 00:09:41In addition to the financial obligations, there's also the average radiation dose. 00:09:48And so, here we can see an x-ray is about 1.5, and we've gone over this before. 00:09:54A bone scan of the whole skeleton here is 6.3 millisieverts. 00:10:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:05In addition, as you're considering whether or not to refer a patient for imaging, remember that you should rarely perform imaging as an exploratory tool. 00:10:15You should have an idea of what the imaging will show, and you should anticipate a course of action based on predicted imaging results. 00:10:24So what this means is that you should have formed a hypothesis regarding what  based on predicted imaging results. 00:10:24So what this means is that you should have formed a hypothesis regarding what you think is going on first. 00:10:29And you should have some idea of what you'll do if your hypothesis proves to be correct. 00:10:34And also, what you'll do if your hypothesis is not correct. 00:10:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:43So as you consider whether or not to refer your patient for imaging, you should reflect on whether the imaging will contribute to a change in your diagnosis or treatment. 00:10:54And a thorough patient examination will help you make appropriate imaging decisions. 00:10:58The history and physical examination are necessary to assist in deciding whether imaging is needed and what type of imaging would be most useful. 00:11:07Prudent use of imaging is informed by a really sound patient examination. 00:11:13If imaging confirms :07Prudent use of imaging is informed by a really sound patient examination. 00:11:13If imaging confirms what is anticipated based on all prior information collected by you and the course of care is routinely managed by physical therapists, then imaging results will not contribute much to your initial plan of care. 00:11:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:34Consider a scenario where a patient is not progressing as expected or their condition is worsening, or consider a case where you're concerned about some serious underlying pathology. 00:11:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:47A patient with anterior hip inguinal and medial thigh pain, which is aggravated by walking, presents to you in the clinic. 00:11:55This patient also has a 20-year history of taking corticosteroids, and because of this, the patient's risk for osteonecrosis of the femoral head is elevated. 00:12:  because of this, the patient's risk for osteonecrosis of the femoral head is elevated. 00:12:07After thoroughly considering the patient's history and physical examination findings, imaging may be warranted prior to proceeding with physical therapy treatment. 00:12:16If the patient did not have a long history of continuous corticosteroid use, then imaging may not be warranted. 00:12:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:26And so what we're looking at here is a avascular necrosis of the femoral head. 00:12:30[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com ice acts approach referral for imaging privileges with language that's categorized as specifically inclusive, interpretable to allow referral, silent, or specifically exclusive. 00:02:02Wisconsin and Utah, for example, allow PTs to refer for imaging. 00:02:07Colorado, Maryland, and Washington DC have some degree of freedom to refer for imaging and interpretations of their practice x. 00:02:15However, practice x of other disciplines, radiology technicians, for example, may limit who the provider can take orders from 00:02:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:28So what that means is that for radiology technicians, the practice act for that discipline may be prescriptive or prohibitive related to whom they can take their orders from. 00:02:40Thus, potentially affecting physical therapist's ability to refer for imaging. 00:02:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:49So why would we refer for imaging in  00:02:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:49So why would we refer for imaging in the first place? 00:02:53Well, first to obtain a more comprehensive evaluation, to see the processes of growth or development or healing, disease or dysfunction. 00:03:02We can integrate imaging with the patient history and other lab or medical data, along with the physical examination, to provide a more complete set of information to base patient care decisions on. 00:03:14Essentially, we would be able to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of care delivery. 00:03:19[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:25Over-utilization is a long-standing problem in referring for imaging. 00:03:30In this study of 2,051 lumbar spine MRIs ordered by general practitioners, 75% of those studies were deemed inappropriate. 00:03:40The majority of these referrals did not meet  general practitioners, 75% of those studies were deemed inappropriate. 00:03:40The majority of these referrals did not meet the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria for imaging a patient with low back pain. 00:03:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:52So what is ACR? 00:03:54American College of, not Rheumatology, this is not correct, the American College of Radiology. 00:04:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:08American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria, ACR, AC for Appropriateness Criteria. 00:04:15So this information helps with assisting in making the most appropriate imaging or treatment decision. 00:04:25In the US, the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria is considered the gold standard decision making guideline. 00:04:34Which imaging modality is recommended for a suspected diagnosis,  is considered the gold standard decision making guideline. 00:04:34Which imaging modality is recommended for a suspected diagnosis, for example, you would turn to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria. 00:04:43The goal of the ACR Appropriateness Criteria is to assist referring physicians and other providers in making the most appropriate imaging or treatment decision for a specific clinical condition. 00:04:57In addition, the ACR is intended to allow providers enhanced quality of care and to contribute to the efficacious use of radiology. 00:05:09So the American College of Rheumatology Appropriateness Criteria is an incredibly useful and important component of decision making in imaging. 00:05:19[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:25Factors for decision making according to the ACR Appropriateness Criteria include age, the presence or absence of trauma and mechanism of injury, prior surgery, pain provocation. 00:05: eria include age, the presence or absence of trauma and mechanism of injury, prior surgery, pain provocation. 00:05:39And then there are also individual risk factors, such as physical appearance, neurologic status, other imaging results, weight-bearing ability and tenderness to palpation. 00:05:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:53So for example, how old is the patient? 00:05:56Under age, an 85-year-old patient with shoulder pain that has been worsening over time suggests differential diagnoses that are different from a 14-year-old with similar symptoms and progression of pain and loss of function. 00:06:11In terms of trauma, presence or absence, when the patient presents, was the injury a result of trauma? 00:06:17Was the mechanism of injury one that might suggest underlying pathology? 00:06:21For example, the patient was reaching for a bag and felt a pop versus the  suggest underlying pathology? 00:06:21For example, the patient was reaching for a bag and felt a pop versus the patient reports waking up with shoulder discomfort. 00:06:30Is there a history of prior surgery? 00:06:32If this patient with shoulder pain has a recent history of full thickness rotator cuff repair, then your differential diagnosis might include a failure of that repair. 00:06:42And finally, physical examination and functional test results. 00:06:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:52So we can imagine a patient presents to you in the clinic with right shoulder pain. 00:06:57And the pain began a couple of weeks ago, and they cannot recall a specific inciting event. 00:07:02Basically, they don't remember doing anything to cause their shoulder to hurt. 00:07:06And so that's what we're looking at here, is a clinical condition, shoulder pain, a traumatic :07:06And so that's what we're looking at here, is a clinical condition, shoulder pain, a traumatic. 00:07:14So an example of applying the ACR appropriateness scale to a patient who presents with shoulder pain that was not the result of trauma. 00:07:22In this table, if your patient's shoulder disorder was severe enough that it limited their function and after a history and physical examination, you might then refer them for x-ray if you suspect a fracture. 00:07:35If, however, you suspect that bony integrity is maintained, right, that you don't suspect a fracture, and instead that the diagnosis is likely a disruption of the soft tissue of the rotator cuff. 00:07:47For example, your patient cannot lift their extremity or strength testing reveals marked deficits that cannot be explained by guarding, that is, instead of an x-ray, an MRI would be the most appropriate imaging modality  be explained by guarding, that is, instead of an x-ray, an MRI would be the most appropriate imaging modality. 00:08:00In this case, at least in Arizona, you would need to refer the patient to their referring provider, along with the suggestion to consider MRI to rule out a meaningful rotator cuff disorder. 00:08:12[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:16I included this slide here because one of the themes that will recur consistently throughout this course is that you must decide whether to treat the patient, to refer the patient out immediately, or to treat the patient and refer them out. 00:08:33[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:35So, if you decide to treat, you're deciding that the patient's condition is within the scope of PT practice. 00:08:42If you're deciding to refer the patient, you've decided that the patient's condition warrants referral to another provider 3.5 Prescribing ImagingEffects00:00:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:02Hi, so welcome to lecture 3.5 on prescribing imaging. 00:00:10So in this lecture, we'll identify three considerations when deciding whether to refer a patient for imaging. 00:00:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:20We'll describe the appropriate imaging components of a request for imaging. 00:00:26We'll identify three negative consequences of imaging. 00:00:29And finally, we'll discuss how imaging results should be interpreted and communicated. 00:00:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:36So when we're referring the patient for imaging, a few things that we need to ask are, do we need additional information to help make a diagnosis, or a more comprehensive evaluation? 00:00:50And then, how severe do you believe the underlying condition could be?  or a more comprehensive evaluation? 00:00:50And then, how severe do you believe the underlying condition could be? 00:00:56And finally, what's the urgency of the referral, right? 00:00:58Do you believe that there's a potential for the underlying condition to become incredibly severe over the next 24 hours? 00:01:05Or do you think it's something that the patient might be able to wait to go see their physician until the next day? 00:01:13So essentially, imaging can provide additional information, really, a more comprehensive evaluation. 00:01:20And that really means that the success of rehabilitation depends on the effectiveness of your evaluation. 00:01:26And so the more thorough your evaluation, some more information you have on which to build your rehab program. 00:01:33So, many of your tools, the observation, the palpation, manual muscle testing, physical performance testing, etc, those are  that low back pain imaging research consistently shows a delay in return to work and lower functional outcomes versus no imaging for the same patients. 00:09:51Second, exposure to ionizing radiation. 00:09:54So you have to monitor over time the cumulative doses or dosage of ionizing radiation, because that effect is cumulative. 00:10:05And finally, a negative consequence of imaging is the potential costs. 00:10:12So, back in the day, for me, it's oh, 2005, 2006, I worked with a group of surgeons, and we had an MRI machine in the office. 00:10:24And at that time, an MRI typically cost around $1,500 to $1,700. 00:10:31And so you can imagine co-pays, or even those cases where a patient may not have insurance to cover the cost of imaging, that's a really important factor to consider as you decide whether or not to refer  have insurance to cover the cost of imaging, that's a really important factor to consider as you decide whether or not to refer that patient. 00:10:48It's not the most important factor, right? 00:10:51Obviously the most important factor is going to be the patient's health and long-term, functional outcome, and ability to return to their usual kinds of life activities. 00:11:04But cost is something that really needs to be considered. 00:11:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:12Interpretation and communication of the imaging results. 00:11:17So your patient has come back and they have their imaging, and the imaging is in their electronic medical record and you can see those images. 00:11:29So the question becomes, do you then look at the images and provide a diagnosis to that patient, right? 00:11:37So the patient hasn't received the diagnosis from the radi  provide a diagnosis to that patient, right? 00:11:37So the patient hasn't received the diagnosis from the radiologist yet. 00:11:42And so, medically and legally, the interpretation of the images is the purview of the radiologist. 00:11:49But PTs, by virtue of their education, training and experience should be able to recognize and understand normal anatomy, including the anatomy associated with usual lifespan changes, or anatomic variance, and then contrast that to abnormal anatomy. 00:12:08But the comprehensive interpretation and description of that anatomy is outside of the current scope of PT practice. 00:12:19Which essentially means that it's probably not a great idea if you have those imaging findings and you don't have a radiologist interpretation along with those findings, all you have is the imaging, to use that imaging to provide a diagnosis to that patient. 00:12:36That is outside of your scope of practice, medically and legally  to provide a diagnosis to that patient. 00:12:36That is outside of your scope of practice, medically and legally. 00:12:42That you really need to wait for the radiologist to interpret the imaging study. 00:12:50So you have to recognize and maintain the practice boundaries regarding interpreting medical imaging. 00:12:57And so, once you have that interpretation from the radiologist, this allows for educating the patient regarding their imaging results. 00:13:05Including what those results mean and the context of each patient's age, gender, and lifestyle, and symptoms, etc. 00:13:13And the physical therapists can also provide reassurance, such as helpful contextual information to the patient to improve the understanding of their imaging results. 00:13:24And that leads to a better informed patient without the potentially negative influences associated with the imaging results, right, or medicalization. 00:13:33And so that's where it's  influences associated with the imaging results, right, or medicalization. 00:13:33And so that's where it's really important for you to be able to look at an image and at least have some idea of what's going on in that image, right? 00:13:42In this case, you're not providing a diagnosis, but by going over what you see in the image and incorporating that with the radiologist's interpretation of the image, the patient can then become better informed and more comfortable with what's being seen in that image or the information contained in that image. 00:14:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:09So routine radiographic examination results can be positive for the suspected diagnosis, negative for the suspected diagnosis. 00:14:19Negative for one diagnosis, but raising suspicion for another diagnosis. 00:14:24Or they could be inconclusive and you could require additional imaging to confirm or rule out the suspected diagnosis. :14:24Or they could be inconclusive and you could require additional imaging to confirm or rule out the suspected diagnosis. 00:14:33And that could actually be mentioned by the radiologist in their follow up. 00:14:38And another possible alternative here is that your initial suspicion was wrong. 00:14:45So, in this case, the images are negative for the pathologic changes that you suspected, but the patient still does not improve with physical therapy. 00:14:54And so the imaging is performed again one month later, demonstrating a stress fracture, for example, at the talar neck, and the patient is referred for surgery. 00:15:04So what I'm kind of getting it, there is that you may have a patient who has some pathology that is present. 00:15:14But it's present in a way that's not been picked up by the imaging, and over time the size or the intensity of that pathology grows  in a way that's not been picked up by the imaging, and over time the size or the intensity of that pathology grows. 00:15:27So, in this example, the fracture size grows and a month later it's large enough that it actually does show up on the imaging. 00:15:38So, you could imagine a patient comes to see you at the clinic and they say that they stepped on the fold of a towel getting out of the shower, resulting in severe pain along the bottom and outside of their foot. 00:15:49And then after completing this patient's history and physical examination, you're worried that maybe they sustained a fracture to their fifth metatarsal. 00:16:00So after talking about this with your patient, you refer the patient for a radiographic examination to rule out that fracture the fifth metatarsal. 00:16:09So, once the patient receives radiographic examination and the results are interpreted by a radiologist, . 00:16:09So, once the patient receives radiographic examination and the results are interpreted by a radiologist, those results are going to include one of the following things that we mentioned before, right? 00:16:19Positive for the suspected diagnosis, negative for one diagnosis, but now there's a suspicion of something else, inconclusive. 00:16:28And then potentially wrong initial suspicion. 00:16:31[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:16:36So when you're speaking with your patient about your imaging results, explain to your patient the results that are relevant to them. 00:16:44You don't need to explain everything you know about imaging and attempt to impress them. 00:16:50And in this slide, I have a little tiny quote that says, you shouldn't tell an audience everything you know. 00:16:57That was an effort to impress them. 00:17:00Instead, you should  you know. 00:16:57That was an effort to impress them. 00:17:00Instead, you should tell them what they need to know. 00:17:03And that's an effort to teach them. 00:17:05And so your goal is to take something that's potentially scary or intimidating and translate it in a way for that patient that allows them to understand the information. 00:17:19And if you do it really well, it allows the patient to become more comfortable with the material contained in that imaging. 00:17:28And more willing to sort of move forward with whatever treatment you decide it's going to be appropriate. 00:17:35So the PT should know when to order diagnostic imaging and how to communicate effectively with the radiologist. 00:17:44And the PT may not have the primary responsibility to interpret the images, but you should be able to identify and manage clinically relevant findings. 00:17:55And  responsibility to interpret the images, but you should be able to identify and manage clinically relevant findings. 00:17:55And to be effective, you have to establish lines of communication with the radiologist, with the patient, front office staff, and you have to build relationships with radiologists and other specialists. 00:18:07So the communication between the physical therapist and the radiologist may be required to determine the next steps after imaging. 00:18:15So, think about scheduling a follow-up visit for your patient as soon as possible after the results of an imaging study are available, or communicate those results by telephone. 00:18:28[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com , many of your tools, the observation, the palpation, manual muscle testing, physical performance testing, etc, those are dependent on your own perceptive skills. 00:01:46And those have some degree of subjectivity and bias and limitation. 00:01:52And imaging can provide an objective visual aspect to the evaluation that makes the expertise of the clinician a little more comprehensive. 00:02:03So supplementing your evaluation and your re-evaluation with images can increase your awareness of the patient in a different dimension. 00:02:14So your knowledge of functional anatomy essentially becomes more dynamically effective because you're able to directly visualize the processes of bone growth and healing, disease and dysfunction, related to findings that are seen on imaging. 00:02:34So the information that you seek is often of a different nature from the information that a physician seeks, and a different nature than what might be described in the radiologist report. 00:02:47So  a physician seeks, and a different nature than what might be described in the radiologist report. 00:02:47So, for example, a physician needs to know whether a fracture of the distal radius that has united with a malunion deformity is clinically stable. 00:02:56And if so, then the cast can be removed and the patient can be sent for rehab. 00:03:01On the other hand, you also need to know the severity and the configuration of the malunion deformity. 00:03:07And so looking at the radiographs, you can become a little more aware of how the joints of the hand, wrist, and forearm, or maybe the elbow have the potential to be affected by the deformity, right? 00:03:20So you can imagine a bony deformity heals in a way that, for example, in the elbow could limit terminal extension. 00:03:28And so you could be trying to stretch , for example, in the elbow could limit terminal extension. 00:03:28And so you could be trying to stretch a person into terminal extension when that range is limited by a bony block that's obviously not going to stretch. 00:03:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:43So referring the patient for imaging, communication with the radiologist or the imaging service before and after the imaging procedure is critical in achieving optimal patient care with continuity. 00:03:59So that means the idea isn't simply to refer your patient out for imaging and then see what happens. 00:04:06It's really going to be incumbent upon you as therapists to make sure that you follow up with the imaging specialist. 00:04:14And so in the APTA standards of practice for physical therapy, it states that a physical therapy service collaborates with all disciplines as appropriate. 00:04:24And the physical therapist must refer patients, clients, to  service collaborates with all disciplines as appropriate. 00:04:24And the physical therapist must refer patients, clients, to the referring practitioner or other health care practitioners if symptoms are present for which physical therapy is contraindicated or are indicative of conditions for which treatment is outside the scope of his or her knowledge. 00:04:42So, really, it's on you to recognize when you might be dealing with something that you're unfamiliar with in a way that you believe warrants additional information outside the scope of physical therapy practice. 00:04:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:04So, when you request imaging in a referral, your request should include relevant clinical information, a working diagnosis, pertinent clinical signs and symptoms, and also a specific question to be answered. 00:05:25And the American College of Radiology encourages that the request for imaging, quote, should provide sufficient information to demonstrate the medical necessity of the examination, and allow for its  that the request for imaging, quote, should provide sufficient information to demonstrate the medical necessity of the examination, and allow for its proper performance and interpretation unquote. 00:05:42And so that means two things, really. 00:05:44One is that you really should only refer those patients who you believe are going to have a high likelihood of benefiting in terms of their outcomes from that imaging. 00:06:02And you should include information that's going to allow the radiologist to use the appropriate imaging modality and the appropriate views to get information that's going to be meaningful for the patient. 00:06:18So, the American College of Rheumatology also states that the referral for imaging should include relevant clinical information on working diagnosis and or pertinent clinical signs and symptoms. 00:06:33And of particular relevance to the importance of a thorough history and physical examination, the referral should contain a specific question to be answered. 00:06:45And complete  a thorough history and physical examination, the referral should contain a specific question to be answered. 00:06:45And complete communication with the imaging referral really helps tailor, like I said before, the most appropriate imaging study for that patient and enhances the usefulness of the imaging report. 00:07:01So rather than simply requesting an x-ray of a patient's elbow, providing information such as suspicion of radial head fracture based on whatever the patient's medical history is, and based on your physical test and measures results, which you would also include in the report. 00:07:20That information can assist in the selection process of the imaging modality and the radiographic views. 00:07:29And so, the imaging is really going to be enhanced with the radiologist being better informed by you of the suspected specific anatomy that you'd like them to look at. 00:07:43So improving the availability of the clinical history and other relevant patient information has been cited in a  at. 00:07:43So improving the availability of the clinical history and other relevant patient information has been cited in a number of different studies as a measure for improving the diagnostic process. 00:07:55And you can also provide your patients with an explanation of tests that you're ordering and why you're ordering them. 00:08:02And you can explain to them the purpose of the test and maybe what you expect to find, and how your treatment plan may change, or their expectations may change, based on the imaging results. 00:08:15Also make sure when you do describe your concerns in a letter to your referral source, that you describe them in a succinct approach. 00:08:29And that you explain that the symptoms aren't consistent with what you would expect. 00:08:33Or that those symptoms may be inconsistent with some group of words that might be useful, like inconsistent with musculoskeletal pathology, or inconsistent with neuromus  some group of words that might be useful, like inconsistent with musculoskeletal pathology, or inconsistent with neuromusculoskeletal pathology, etc. 00:08:50But something to sort of hint that additional medical specialization may be needed in order to uncover whatever is actually going on. 00:09:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:07What about the negative consequences of imaging? 00:09:10These are things that you also need to weigh as you decide whether or not to refer that patient back for additional medical evaluation. 00:09:20One is the idea of medicalization. 00:09:23And this means a negative impact on the patient's psychosocial status, possible negative impact on outcomes related to their medical condition as a result of additional medical studies. 00:09:38So we know that low back pain imaging research consistently shows a delay in return to work and lower functional outcomes versus no imaging for the same patients 3.6 Imaging Studies00:00:02Hi, and welcome to this lecture on imaging studies. 00:00:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:10So the objectives of this lecture are, to describe some kinds of musculoskeletal imaging studies, that there are lots of clients with this particular lecture will include. 00:00:24Arthrography, myelography, conventional tomography, computed tomography, nuclear imaging, bone scintigraphy, magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, and ultrasonography. 00:00:42And then we'll also describe the functional view imaging. 00:00:47So, lots of stuff here. 00:00:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:52So other common musculoskeletal imaging studies, contrast enhanced radiographs or arthrography. 00:00:59So that's where we inject, a contrast substance, into a  or arthrography. 00:00:59So that's where we inject, a contrast substance, into a joint and the injected material distends the joint capsule and the internal tissues. 00:01:13So the synovium and the ligaments and the articular cartilage and the joint capsule abnormalities can all be imaged using this technique. 00:01:23So if we look at the top image here A, that's a negative contrast study of the knee. 00:01:32And you can note the full extent of the capsule here, as it's distended by the contrast, that's what these little white dashes are, right? 00:01:42You can imagine that that thing kind of filling up with that fluid, and then down to here at B, this is a shoulder arthrogram. 00:01:51And so after injection of contrast into the glenohumeral joint. 00:01:56There's . 00:08:22And then the avascular necrosis down here. 00:08:25[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:30And so tumors of bone and soft tissue, fractures, joint abnormalities, bone fragments, and metabolic bone disorders can all benefit from the use of Computed Tomography 00:08:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:51So nuclear imaging, nuclear imaging uses radiopharmaceuticals or radioactive tracers to diagnose based on the physiological or the functional changes of the tissue or organ. 00:09:05And so, the pharma side targets a particular organ while the radionuclide emits gamma rays. 00:09:12And the tracers are absorbed by the target organ in varying amounts based on the level of metabolic activity in the tissue. 00:09:21So, in this image here, a 16-year-old girl is diagnosed with lymphoma and sent for PET/CT scan , in this image here, a 16-year-old girl is diagnosed with lymphoma and sent for PET/CT scan before starting chemotherapy. 00:09:33And you can see how the metabolic data from the PET scan and the anatomic data from the CT scan are combined. 00:09:41So, here's the PET scan right here, and here's the CT scan and we combine the two. 00:09:49To get this the pet CT scan and the tumor uses the tracer as fuel, and so it ends up lighting up with increased uptake. 00:10:01And that seen in the right upper region of the chest. 00:10:04[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:10:07And, apparently, after six months of chemotherapy, a repeat scan showed a significant reduction of the tumor, indicating that the treatment was successful. 00:10:18But I think the important takeaway here is understanding that you're taking the image  the treatment was successful. 00:10:18But I think the important takeaway here is understanding that you're taking the image qualities of the PET scan here, combining them with the CT scan, to produce this image here. 00:10:32So this is extremely useful in detecting tumors or tumor progression or regression. 00:10:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:46So radionuclide Imaging studies, radionuclide bone scan or bone scan or bone scintigraphy, really increased uptake of tracers generally occur under abnormal conditions where there's high metabolic activity. 00:11:03And this is visualized as black areas or hot spots on an image. 00:11:09And so bone scans highlight areas of hyperfunction or increased mineral turnover. 00:11:16So if we look at image A here, bone scans of three different patients, each with three different diagnoses, degenerative arthritis and metastatic cancer and acute trauma. , bone scans of three different patients, each with three different diagnoses, degenerative arthritis and metastatic cancer and acute trauma. 00:11:29The point is that all the scans look alike because they only measure hypermetabolism. 00:11:35Thus, bone scans are not independent studies, but they have to be corelated with clinical data to be meaningful. 00:11:42And so image A, the patient has a degenerative joint disease in multiple sites. 00:11:47And so we can see, the arrows indicating increased uptake in the cervical spine. 00:11:55Here, see how it's black, and the wrist here, it's black, and in the ankles. 00:12:03You can also see in the knee here. 00:12:07And that actually is a prosthesis at the knee joint, so a total knee replacement. 00:12:14And then if we look at E right there, that patient  joint, so a total knee replacement. 00:12:14And then if we look at E right there, that patient suffered a bruise to their glute medius muscle during football game. 00:12:23And increase uptake was an early indication of myositis ossificans developing in the muscle, so these two things here. 00:12:32So this person either landed on that side or someone hit them here, and now we have this development of bone that's turning over at a much increased rate versus everywhere else in the pelvis. 00:12:49Then if we look at C here, this patient has known lung cancer and the bone scan is done to identify the distribution of metastatic lesions in the skeleton. 00:13:00And increased uptake at the right scapula and the right shoulder shows areas of metastatic bone cancer so that's here and so that's the scapula. 00:13:12What? 00:13  bone cancer so that's here and so that's the scapula. 00:13:12What? 00:13:13Over the top of that thing. 00:13:16[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:19So anyway, here and here. 00:13:24And so, we can see this is the right shoulder here's the humerus coming down here, and here's the torso there. 00:13:31[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:36So, the limitation here is just this lack of specificity, right? 00:13:39All we can see is that there's bone turnover. 00:13:41We're not able to distinguish what process is causing the increased uptake of bone or the increased bone turnover. 00:13:48So, you have to have other clinical evaluations. 00:13:51Correlated with your bone scan in order to make a diagnosis for radionucl  other clinical evaluations. 00:13:51Correlated with your bone scan in order to make a diagnosis for radionuclide bone scan or bone scintigraphy. 00:13:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:06So magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, no ionizing radiation is produced by the MRI, and the inflammation is instead produced by the interaction of the tissue with a magnetic field. 00:14:22MRI is primarily used in the evaluation of soft tissue trauma and joint derangement and tumors. 00:14:29And so this image here is an MRI of the cervical spine. 00:14:35And in a here you can see the pons and B, you can see the spinal cord and C you can see the marrow of the C two vertebral body and D you can Visualize the, the intervertebral disc,C4, and five, right? 00:14:56So here's four, here  intervertebral disc,C4, and five, right? 00:14:56So here's four, here's five, here's the disc. 00:15:00Right? 00:15:01Here's three. 00:15:02[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:15:16So ultrasonography or musculoskeletal ultrasound. 00:15:21These images are generated using reflected sound waves. 00:15:25Like an MRI, there's no exposure to ionizing radiation, and it's non-invasive imaging. 00:15:34Different tissues absorb and reflect the sound waves uniquely. 00:15:39Diagnostic ultrasound is useful for lesions to muscles and tendons, ligaments, detection of cysts and soft tissue tumors. 00:15:48And for the measurement of blood flow. 00:15:52One meaningful advantage of ultrasound is that the images can be made during the physical examination of  blood flow. 00:15:52One meaningful advantage of ultrasound is that the images can be made during the physical examination of tissues, such as during muscle contractions or passive stretching, or even while performing special tests. 00:16:05So it's a very functional kind of imaging runs there the patient remaining static like they would be for an MRI or an X-ray. 00:16:15The patient can actually be moving and you can visualize the structures as they move through space. 00:16:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:16:31The functional view of imaging starts with the patient and the evaluation, including the history and the physical. 00:16:38As opposed, you decide that something doesn't seem quite right, so you refer the patient out for imaging, and the patient undergoes imaging, the report's generated, the radiologist makes the diagnosis. 00:16:51And then proceed with treatment either a physical therapy or physical therapy , the radiologist makes the diagnosis. 00:16:51And then proceed with treatment either a physical therapy or physical therapy is not appropriate with some other kinds of treatments. 00:16:59Essentially, diagnostic imaging is a link in a larger chain that starts and ends with the patient. 00:17:06So you have a picture or an image, but humans play a critical role in the imaging system. 00:17:12Through their interpretation of the image and by their correlation of the clinical findings with the information from that imaging. 00:17:19So the clinicians responsibility really is to recognize that if the results of imaging that imaging study don't fit the physical findings, then further clinical evaluation and diagnostic investigation are warranted. 00:17:35[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com 01:51And so after injection of contrast into the glenohumeral joint. 00:01:56There's a filling of the sub acromial and sub deltoid bursa complex here indicating a rotator cuff tear. 00:02:06Then down and see this bottom image this is a corneal CT arthrogram of the wrist and it demonstrates leak of contrast with a radiocarpal joint through a tear and the scapula lunate ligament. 00:02:19So here we see the contrast right there. 00:02:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:25| And so this is a finding that you wouldn't be able to see on just an X-ray of the wrist. 00:02:30And so that's why these Contrast enhanced radiographs are [UNKNOWN] arthography can be extremely useful. 00:02:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02  | cielo24.com KNOWN] arthography can be extremely useful. 00:02:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:44So other common musculoskeletal imaging studies include myelography, and that's contrast enhanced radiographs. 00:02:55Of the spinal cord, the nerve root, or the dura mater. 00:03:01And, so if we look at these images here this is A, and this is B here. 00:03:06A and B are anterior posterior and lateral views made after injection of contrast into the fecal sac. 00:03:14And this conventional biogram can identify where the flow of contrast is restricted, but it can't identify the reason for the restriction, right? 00:03:23So this is an X-ray. 00:03:26And so we can see the contrast material here in A. 00:03:30I could see it here and be here, down here,  see the contrast material here in A. 00:03:30I could see it here and be here, down here, but there's a space here. 00:03:39And so from the radiograph, we can see that something's going on. 00:03:42There's a space, and it's not continuous that flow of contrast material, right? 00:03:47It doesn't flow continuously from here, all the way down, something's interrupting that flow. 00:03:53Now we compare these with our CT myelogram down here right again, this is X-ray radiography and this is a CT. 00:04:01So we compare this with our with our CT myelogram and C is a coronal reformatted image and D is a sagittal reformat. 00:04:11And there's normal contrast filling the fecal space at all areas except at L1. 00:04:20And so when  there's normal contrast filling the fecal space at all areas except at L1. 00:04:20And so when we look up here at L1, there's a bony defect that impinges on the fecal sac and indents the column of contrast. 00:04:31And so that, if we look at image D right here that's occurring right here. 00:04:38So we can see this is really bright area because see how it's coming into the fecal sac, boy I really messed that up there we go. 00:04:46So you can see that now hopefully. 00:04:51And we can also look at C, and we can see here that we have contrast coming down here. 00:04:58And then there's a broken area. 00:05:00Okay, so the CT gives us a little more information than just the radiography. 00:05:10And so the other thing that I  CT gives us a little more information than just the radiography. 00:05:10And so the other thing that I think is important here is that you can actually see the conus medullaris of the spinal cord and the star right here. 00:05:19[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:22And then, down here you can actually see the Cotter going down there. 00:05:30So the advantage of the CT is the direct visualization of the soft tissues, and you can actually see the cause of the impingement, right? 00:05:38We can actually see this area right here. 00:05:45And if we look up here, all we can see is that, there's something going on so with with the Radiography essentially the take home I think here is with the radio radiography. 00:05:56We get sort of a general idea that yes, something's wrong. 00:06  radiography. 00:05:56We get sort of a general idea that yes, something's wrong. 00:06:00And with the CT, we can actually see okay, there's something going wrong and it looks like it's occurring here at L one. 00:06:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:12So, another common musculoskeletal imaging study is tomography and conventional tomography or body section radiography. 00:06:21Conventional tomography is the radiographic evaluation of one plane of the body. 00:06:27And the depth can be modified by adjusting the equipment a little bit. 00:06:33And the principle of dimensional tomography is that you have an X-ray tube and the film moves in an opposite direction from the X-ray tube. 00:06:43Right, so, here we have our X-ray tube up here. 00:06:46Here we have :43Right, so, here we have our X-ray tube up here. 00:06:46Here we have our film down here and they move in opposite directions. 00:06:54The focal point, which is right here, that open circle remains in sharp focus while the other planes of the body, the dark circles become blurred by the motion. 00:07:07So imaging different depths of bone can allow a better understanding of the extent of a fracture, give you a little more information about it. 00:07:15And the evaluation of bony tumors can also be aided by conventional tomography. 00:07:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:27So, as opposed to conventional tomography, this is computed tomography, and what it does is it merges images from X-rays using a computer. 00:07:36Which reconstructs an axial cross-sectional slice of an image. 00:07:41 . 00:07:36Which reconstructs an axial cross-sectional slice of an image. 00:07:41And then processing can also reconstruct the data obtained in one plane and resolve it into multiple other planes. 00:07:47So, for example, data obtained in the axial plane can be resolved into sagittal, coronal, and even three-dimensional images like we see here. 00:07:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:01And so, this oblique view of the wrist demonstrates a fracture through the waist of the scaphoid bone that's been complicated by avascular necrosis of the proximal fragment. 00:08:13So, we see here an S right here, this fracture, 00:08:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:20And one there. 00:08:22And then the avascular necrosis down here. 00:08:25[BLANK_
