4.1 Why View Diagnostic Images?Effects00:00:00[MUSIC] 00:00:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:09Hi and welcome to week four, and so we are going to talk a little bit more about general principles and radiology. 00:00:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:20So this first section is really dedicated to describing why clinicians need to view diagnostic images. 00:00:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:34Unnecessary examinations and the overutilization of x-rays. 00:00:39And if we look at the quote for number 1, it is easier to order an x-ray than to think. 00:00:45And so we're dealing with an issue and we're trying to avoid overutilization. 00:00:51And overutilization means excessive radiation per unit of diagnostic information or therapeutic impact or health utilization. 00:00:51And overutilization means excessive radiation per unit of diagnostic information or therapeutic impact or health outcome. 00:01:00Essentially trying to limit the amount of radiation per useful bit of knowledge. 00:01:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:09That includes excessive radiation per image, or excessive images per exam, or excessive examinations per patient. 00:01:18We want that number to be as small as possible. 00:01:21Examples might be, how useful is imaging of the skull when you're evaluating a patient for headache, or neck pain, or vertigo, or seizures? 00:01:33A single lateral image would be adequate and would result in about a 75% to 80% reduction in radiation exposure versus other kinds of interventions. 00:01:46Lateral imaging, for example, of the chest and individuals under age 40 may add no new information and could safely be eliminated in the  film finding that can be linked to the acute problem or that can be treated with an intervention linked to findings from imaging. 00:08:42Disc herniation cannot be identified. 00:08:44Tumors or infections are not usually considered unless there are specific criteria such as atypical pain, intravenous drug use for other potential causes of infection, history of cancer, etc. 00:08:56So instead, regardless of the findings on the x-ray image, modalities to reduce pain along with exercise or advice to stay active will invariably be the treatment of choice. 00:09:08A lumbar spine x-ray series may be useful in cases of severe trauma, or possible metastatic tumor, or infection. 00:09:16Acute low back pain with, sorry, acute low back pain with radiculopathy is not an indication for x-rays. 00:09:23An MRI would be more useful for showing a disk her  is not an indication for x-rays. 00:09:23An MRI would be more useful for showing a disk herniation, but that should only be considered after conservative treatments such as physical therapy has failed. 00:09:33And ankle series, around 30,000 of these were reported every day in North America, and they're the most common cause for emergency department visits. 00:09:43An evidence-based history and physical examination using the American College of Radiology criteria and the Ottawa ankle rules can reduce ankle imaging by 50% without ever missing a fracture. 00:09:55So tiny bony avulsions in the foot and ankle will be treated the same as ligament tears. 00:10:01So because x-ray is not a factor in determining the patient's treatment, it can probably be avoided. 00:10:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:08The cervical spine and the cervical spine x-ray series :07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:08The cervical spine and the cervical spine x-ray series, emergency departments routinely order C-pine films on all trauma patients because they're worried about not stabilizing a fractured back. 00:10:21Research has demonstrated consistently that patients who are alert and have no C-spine pain have almost no chance of having a fracture. 00:10:30If the patient doesn't lag and has no pain with cervical motion, no posterior midline tenderness, and no neurologic deficits, no C-spine x-rays should be performed. 00:10:41In the case of trauma, you can usually skip plain film and the patient is likely going to go straight to a CT scan to ensure that fractures are moved out. 00:10:49However, a CT may not show ligamentous disruption, but should be more easily seen on MRI. 00:10:55So in sum, there are  ligamentous disruption, but should be more easily seen on MRI. 00:10:55So in sum, there are a lot of things that typically will receive imaging, but from an evidence-based standpoint, probably the imaging isn't absolutely necessary. 00:11:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:14Interpreting images in radiology, develop a search pattern and understand that the diagnosis is going to be complicated by normal anatomic variance, multiple diagnoses such as the second fracture. 00:11:28And the second fracture refers to when we become so fixated on diagnosing a particular fracture in a certain area that we end up missing a meaningful fracture in a separate area. 00:11:42Letter C, variations in how a disease may present, and D, insignificant findings, which become significant over time. 00:11:51So using a search pattern may seem to make diagnosing easy, but the interpretation can actually be very difficult. 00 :51So using a search pattern may seem to make diagnosing easy, but the interpretation can actually be very difficult. 00:11:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:02So interpreting images in radiology, the pitfalls. 00:12:07Number 1, we have errors of observation, 2, errors of interpretation. 00:12:13And 3, we can reduce errors by learning to appropriately communicate with the radiologist. 00:12:22So errors of observation have to do with a faulty search pattern usually. 00:12:27Errors of interpretation are the practitioner's failure to link abnormal radiologic signs to meaningful clinical data. 00:12:36And errors in reading images are inevitable. 00:12:40You just have to accept that they're going to occur, and occasionally things will be missed. 00:12:45[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | :12:45[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com  imaging, for example, of the chest and individuals under age 40 may add no new information and could safely be eliminated in the vast majority of cases. 00:01:56Oblique films of the lumbar spine in children are probably not useful, but they do result in high doses of radiation. 00:02:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:07So if we look at number 3, the lack of knowledge of the limitations of radiology, right, that can also cause overutilization. 00:02:14Essentially, it's the lack of knowledge regarding what radiology can and what radiology cannot do. 00:02:21And then what about number 4, the reliance on radiologic versus clinical findings? 00:02:27So there's the potential for an undue dependence on radiology. 00:02:32Are repeat examinations necessary? 00:02:35And if so, how frequently to follow up on a routine 02:32Are repeat examinations necessary? 00:02:35And if so, how frequently to follow up on a routine fracture healing, for example, especially if the patient's functional changes and symptoms depict their responses to treatment. 00:02:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:51Number 5 is the belief that every possible step is being taken to obtain a diagnosis, and so the clinician's need for action and certainty, right? 00:03:01A PT may need to feel secure that they have taken every possible step to solve the puzzle of obtaining a diagnosis. 00:03:09So to resolve uncertainty, does bringing the radiologist into the decision making process really add value, does it cause harm? 00:03:17In other words, occasionally during this process, a clinician may feel that more is always considered better, but it may be useful to consider, for example, how much better and at what cost? 00:03:  better, but it may be useful to consider, for example, how much better and at what cost? 00:03:32So be careful of using radiologic examination as a form of psychotherapy that gives some kind of degree of assurance or reassurance that may or may not be justified. 00:03:44Taking an action, such as ordering imaging, whether or not it improves the ability to treat the underlying condition, really offers little benefit to the patient. 00:03:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:01So continuing with unnecessary examinations, why is there overutilization of x-rays? 00:04:09Well, part of it is patient demand. 00:04:11The patient may request an x-ray, whether or not it's relevant. 00:04:14For example, demanding an x-ray of an ankle, following a sprain, despite evidence from a set of rules indicating that imaging is probably not going to ray of an ankle, following a sprain, despite evidence from a set of rules indicating that imaging is probably not going to be incredibly useful. 00:04:25Reimbursement policies, when imaging is covered, you may be less concerned about the economic burden on patients. 00:04:32But as costs rise, or patients are required to fund, the likelihood of you ordering imaging may decline. 00:04:42Number 3, defensive medicine, so this really concerns the idea of malpractice. 00:04:51So back in the 1970s, research already suggested around 30% of x-rays were performed defensively by clinicians who may have been concerned about taking every possible step to guarantee that nothing has been missed. 00:05:06Regardless of the cost or the potential harm in terms of financial, or radiation, or the things that we've discussed previously. 00:05:15So there's a belief that if a finding is not documented, that the provider 've discussed previously. 00:05:15So there's a belief that if a finding is not documented, that the provider could be sued. 00:05:21And experts in the field suggest that these types of examinations are not valid, and that future litigation may instead result from unnecessary radiation exposure, because of needless examinations rather than from too few examinations. 00:05:35Finally, economic incentive, so physician-owned imaging units, staff in these offices ordering their own imaging, interpreting them, and rendering charges. 00:05:45There's an incentive to perform more rather than fewer imaging studies. 00:05:51Even 40 years ago, non-radiologist physicians who owned their own extra equipment used an average of twice as many x-ray examinations as their colleagues who referred out to radiologists. 00:06:04So in summary, unnecessary radiological examinations can result in excess costs, excess radiation, wasting a patient's time, wasting a clinician's time,  radiological examinations can result in excess costs, excess radiation, wasting a patient's time, wasting a clinician's time, false hope and expectations, increased worry over findings which are not clinically meaningful. 00:06:21And they indicate a breakdown in the logical thought pattern concerning the patient's workup. 00:06:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:35So examples of unnecessary examinations then, and these are all taken from a radiology textbook for radiology residents. 00:06:45So taking imaging of a nasal bone to rule out a broken nose. 00:06:49And this is unnecessary because if there's a fracture of a nasal bone, it won't be casted and it will not be reduced, and no treatment will be given regardless of what the x-ray shows. 00:07:01Even if the nasal bone is displaced badly enough to warrant an intervention, a CT facial series to be useful only to search for additional fractures  the nasal bone is displaced badly enough to warrant an intervention, a CT facial series to be useful only to search for additional fractures. 00:07:11How about rib imaging? 00:07:13Well, fractured ribs are not uncommon, however, finding a rib fracture after trauma has almost no clinical significance and really does not alter treatment. 00:07:23A pneumothorax or even a lung contusion may be ruled out by chest films, but a rib series isn't necessary. 00:07:30A rib x-ray on a patient with rib pain to find a fracture that really serves little purpose other than to find a cause for the pain, and eliminating this series of rib imaging really will not change the course of the patient's treatment. 00:07:45Coccyx imaging to rule out a fracture isn't necessary because a fracture of the coccyx will not be casted or reduced, just like the nasal bone. 00:07:54  fracture of the coccyx will not be casted or reduced, just like the nasal bone. 00:07:54So in addition, a meaningfully higher dose of gonadal radiation results from a coccyx x-ray. 00:08:01So because no change in treatment will occur, regardless of imaging results, coccyx imaging is likely not necessary. 00:08:09Lumbar spine, so these x-rays, research suggests, are the most abused examinations of radiology. 00:08:16They result in the highest gonadal radiation dose of any x-ray examination, equivalent to a daily chest x-ray for six years. 00:08:25And in the vast majority of cases, they offer no useful diagnostic information. 00:08:31In patients under 40, there is almost no x-ray plain film finding that can be linked to the acute problem or that can be treated with an intervention linked to findings from imaging. 00 4.2 Examinations and Interpreting ImagesEffects00:00:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:01So welcome to lecture 4.2, and we're going to continue with general principles in radiology. 00:00:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:16Our objectives for this portion are to describe bone remodeling and how it is related to function and then identify. 00:00:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:30Two kinds of errors when interpreting images and then define the ABCS or ABCs of how to begin radiographic analysis. 00:00:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:47So let's continue with radiologic evaluations, search patterns and diagnosis. 00:00:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:57So most of you have probably heard of Wolff's Law and well, this slide discusses the inner architecture of 00:57So most of you have probably heard of Wolff's Law and well, this slide discusses the inner architecture of bones and its importance for bone growth. 00:01:06And this is the original article published by Julius Wolff in 1870. 00:01:13This is where Wolff's Law comes from. 00:01:15[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:23Bone remodels continuously throughout life and that remodeling is directly related to the function. 00:01:30So, if we see here, Wolff's law use it, so you don't lose it. 00:01:37Julius Wolff's law was basically, as a consequence of the primary shape variations in the continuous loading or even due to loading a long bone changes its architecture according to some mathematical rules. 00:01:55And as a secondary effect and governed by those same rules, the bone shape also changes. 00:02:01[BL . 00:09:03And some examples for altered size of bones include gigantism, or has used disease or acromegaly. 00:09:11For extra bone you might see polydactyly, congenital anomalies might include a cervical rib or transitional vertebra at lumbosacral junction. 00:09:23And for the absence of bones, we could think of things like possibly an amputation or congenital abnormality. 00:09:29And then finally for developmental deformities scoliosis or genu valgum are pretty decent examples of that. 00:09:36[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:43So starting on the left, we have Paget's disease here, and that's the random proliferation of osteoblastic and osteoplastic activity. 00:09:53So bone formation and bone resorption that's just random. 00:09:58And it produces these curious fluffy areas as  bone formation and bone resorption that's just random. 00:09:58And it produces these curious fluffy areas as fluffy sclerosis of the enlarged skull. 00:10:04And this elderly man here with acid. 00:10:06So these are the clip areas here. 00:10:11And so the lateral view of the skull gets an appearance of spots of, quote, cotton wool, unquote, that's what it's referred to. 00:10:18And this is a classic radiographic finding during later stages of Paget's disease. 00:10:24In the middle, we have polydactyly in a ten month old child. 00:10:27And what you should note here is the six digit, right? 00:10:29So we have one, two, three, four, five, six. 00:10:35[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:37And finally, on the far  six. 00:10:35[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:37And finally, on the far right over here, we have congenital deformities in an eight-month-old girl, which include bowing of the femurs and bowing of the tibias with an absence of fibulas. 00:10:55There aren't any femurs aren't any fibula is present there are fevers present. 00:11:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:07So continuing with alignment, remember to contour bone, so we're looking at the general contour bone. 00:11:14This includes internal and external irregularities. 00:11:18The cortical outline of each bone osteophytes breaks or gaps in the continuity of the cortex, or markings related to past surgeries. 00:11:29So some examples of internal and external irregularities could be related to disease or trauma or developmental or congenital factors. 11:29So some examples of internal and external irregularities could be related to disease or trauma or developmental or congenital factors. 00:11:39The cortical outline following should be smooth and continuous that we should imagine for example in the long run we should see this. 00:11:49Osteophytes or bony upwards that occur at joint margins that are usually associated with degenerative changes of cartilage. 00:11:58Along with those, a spur is an osteophyte that looks pointy and isolated, and can also form tension at tissue attachment sites. 00:12:08So breaks are gaps and the continuity of the cortex of the bone signify a fracture usually markings related to surgical history can include bone graft donation sites or drill holes for surgical implants such as plates or other fixation devices. 00:12:26Note that alignment architecture and alignment contour aren't mutually exclusive. 00:12:32So for example, the dementia in general deformation in architecture also  contour aren't mutually exclusive. 00:12:32So for example, the dementia in general deformation in architecture also falls under bony contour. 00:12:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:47So continuing with some imaging examples here, we'll start on the left with this osteophyte or heel spur and this is seen as a radio-dense projection at the margin of the anterior inferior surface of the calcaneus. 00:13:02We can see that in the little black circle there. 00:13:06Next in the middle here we have an example of a cortical fracture, seen in a complete fracture of the fifth metacarpal neck at the arrowhead here. 00:13:16This is referred to as a boxer's fracture. 00:13:22Finally, note the odd appearance of old surgical sites corresponding with the arrowheads. 00:13:29And this patient had a fibular fracture and  appearance of old surgical sites corresponding with the arrowheads. 00:13:29And this patient had a fibular fracture and a dislocation which was repaired with a plate running along the shaft of the fibula and compression screws across the tibia to reestablish the stability of the ankle bones. 00:13:42And you can see faint remnants of the drill holes. 00:13:45And there's these radiolucent lines, and you can also see faint lines across the tibia that are radio-dense. 00:13:51So hardware like this is usually not removed until it becomes problematic as a result of infection or loosening. 00:13:57So we can see these white arrows here, and corresponding with those, you can see faint lines right here. 00:14:05We have hardware and also right here we look at this arrow and see this pink line. 00:14:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:  at this arrow and see this pink line. 00:14:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:19Finally, under alignment number three, position of bones relative to other bones. 00:14:23So the alignment of bones relative to other bones, we want to assess for normal positional relationships, looking for fracture or dislocation or subluxation. 00:14:35And a fracture can disrupt a joint articulation, usually it's due to trauma. 00:14:40A dislocation will also disrupt normal articulation, also due to trauma. 00:14:45A subluxation, on the other hand, is a partial dislocation, and that can be related to trauma, but can also be related to degenerative changes that result in changes of the congruence between joint and joint laxity. 00:14:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:15:04So on the far left is a normal shoulder, followed :58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:15:04So on the far left is a normal shoulder, followed by an image of the humerus posteriorly dislocated from the glenoid. 00:15:12And so the glenoid is this area right here, you can see. 00:15:17The humerus sort of obscures the posterior aspect of the glenoid in this picture on the left. 00:15:23However, on the right or in the middle here, you can see the full glenoid because that humerus is dislocated posteriorly. 00:15:32Now on the far right we see an image of a dislocated hip. 00:15:37And it's rare, and in this case it was the result of a road traffic accident and the patient underwent a closed reduction in recovery. 00:15:46And so what we can see here is this is where the femur should  closed reduction in recovery. 00:15:46And so what we can see here is this is where the femur should be, and this is where the femur hits 00:15:53[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com And as a secondary effect and governed by those same rules, the bone shape also changes. 00:02:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:05And so we see here on this side, what this is illustrating is really the inner architecture of the bone here. 00:02:12And we can see these very dense areas here and less dense areas here. 00:02:18And the theory here, according to Julius Wolff, is that that architecture or that density shape change based on the kinds of loading that the bone is exposed to over time. 00:02:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:35So the direction and pattern of loading influences the pattern of the trabecular framework. 00:02:43And this is a drawing of forces and trajectories of forces affecting bone and the force distribution. 00:02:50And so on the left here this is supposed to be a curved beam and on the right  distribution. 00:02:50And so on the left here this is supposed to be a curved beam and on the right here is a femur. 00:02:59And the drawings represent the forces that the beam is exposed to and the forces that the femur is exposed to. 00:03:07And we can see the trabecular patterns and the stress trajectories of this this beam and how they're kind of similar, right? 00:03:14And so that's sort of the inside. 00:03:15[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:18So the architecture of the human femur and it was compared with these sort of mathematically constructed stress trajectories on this beam. 00:03:29And that was to show how a human femur can be loaded in a single leg stance was sort of idealized. 00:03:37But the structure was called Coleman's Crane. 00:03:41And the  of idealized. 00:03:37But the structure was called Coleman's Crane. 00:03:41And the takeaway here was really that besides the basic static relationships, the arrangement of the cross section, the inside of the bone and this beam. 00:03:55And the mechanical influences of the muscle tension, and the ligament tension, and the loading, those all influence the shape and the inner structure. 00:04:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:12And this was important because Wolf was basically convinced that the similarities between those stress trajectories in the brain on the left and the trabecular patterns and human femur were coincidental. 00:04:27And so he hypothesized that the direction and the pattern of loading influences or controls the pattern of the trabecular framework in the bone, so that's sort of the origin of Wolf's emphasis on mathematical laws. 00:04:41In other words, that there  that's sort of the origin of Wolf's emphasis on mathematical laws. 00:04:41In other words, that there's a direct mathematical relationship between the form or the shape of bone and the load that's imparted on that bone over time. 00:04:54[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:57So, remember that bone remodels continuously throughout life, and that the remodeling of bone is directly related to the function of the bone. 00:05:06And when we look at this slide up at the top, the first thing you'll see here is this ACL tear. 00:05:12And this is illustrating, for example, an A on the left, this is a bone that's been exposed to an ACL tear right here. 00:05:25And on the right, this is a bone that has not been exposed to an ACL tear. 00:05:30And so we see variations in bone shape that are associated with  not been exposed to an ACL tear. 00:05:30And so we see variations in bone shape that are associated with the abnormal kinematics, right, so the joints move differently after an ACL reconstruction. 00:05:40So we can look at the shape here, right here, of the medial femoral condyle, how it's sort of an oval. 00:05:48And then on the non-ACL tear we can see the medial femoral condyle is more of a circular shape. 00:05:54On the left over here we can see the medial tibial slope here is pretty straight across and on the right and the normal you can see that there's actually sort of a slope on the medial tibia. 00:06:13And in B, what we're looking at here is coxa valga, so an increased angle between the head and neck of the femur. 00:06:23And the point of showing you  so an increased angle between the head and neck of the femur. 00:06:23And the point of showing you this was to illustrate how the stress changes based on the angle of the neck of the femur. 00:06:31And so the darker are higher values of stress. 00:06:38And then finally you can see over here we're looking at bone remodeling in a person with osteoarthritis with some bone marrow edema and knee pain. 00:06:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:59So, when viewing images, there are two kinds of errors when interpreting an image. 00:07:04One is an error of observation due to an incomplete or a faulty search pattern. 00:07:10Two are errors of interpretation, and that's the health care provider's failure to link the findings from the imaging to meaningful clinical data. 00:07:22Both of these can be reduced when the referring provider  the findings from the imaging to meaningful clinical data. 00:07:22Both of these can be reduced when the referring provider, for example a physical therapist offers their expertise from their specialty. 00:07:30To collaborate with the radiologists to improve the quantity and the quality of information that in turn increases the likelihood of a positive patient outcome. 00:07:40So in a nutshell, what I'd like to sort of convey with this slide is the more and the higher the quality of the information you can provide to the individual who is going to be taking the images and interpreting the images, the more likely you are to get some useful information from that imaging, and the more likely you are to help the patient. 00:08:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:09So ABCS, the ABCs, how to search through radiologic imaging. 00:08:15And we have alignment, bone density, cartilage spaces, and soft tissues,  radiologic imaging. 00:08:15And we have alignment, bone density, cartilage spaces, and soft tissues, these are the four things that we look at. 00:08:24And ABCS is the search pattern for radiologic image interpretation. 00:08:29And note that there are three components for each A, B and C, and there are five components for the S, the soft tissues. 00:08:37You can also see table 2-1 in your McKinnis text for more information 00:08:43[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:08:45So we'll begin with alignment and alignment we're looking at skeletal architecture first. 00:08:51So skeletal architecture we're looking at changes in the size of bones or extra bones, congenital anomalies, the absence of bones or developmental deformities. 00:09:03And some examples for altered size of bones include gigantism, or has used disease or ac 4.3 Bone Remodeling and ABCS–A00:00:01So we'll continue with part three, general principles and radiology. 00:00:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:10And our objective in this lecture is to continue with the ABCs of how to begin a radiographic analysis. 00:00:19And in this lecture, we're going to explore bone density and cartilage space. 00:00:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:28So in the ABCDs for B, which stands for bone density, we're looking at number 1 of 3. 00:00:36And number 1 is skeletal architecture. 00:00:39So the general bone density is what we're looking at here, and we're going to assess the shade of gray, looking for shades of gray and then apply sufficient radiographic contrast between the bone and the soft tissue, and sufficient contrast within the bone itself  shades of gray and then apply sufficient radiographic contrast between the bone and the soft tissue, and sufficient contrast within the bone itself. 00:00:55So sufficient contrast between the bone and soft tissue, what this means is that healthy bone and soft tissue appear with clearly different or distinct shades of gray. 00:01:06And sufficient contrast within the bone itself means between the denser cortical shell of each bone and the less dense cancerous bone center. 00:01:16And the healthy cortex shows up with greater density than the cancerous bone, and it appears as a white margin along the bone shafts. 00:01:23And so what this means is that if we're looking at a long bone, the outside of the bone here, the edges will appear bright and the insides here will appear less bright. 00:01:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:46And on the left, we're looking at the normal density of a prox 're looking at degenerative changes of the medial knee. 00:08:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:09And so in this AP view of the knee, what you should see is this classic radiographic hallmark of arthritis, which is demonstrated by decreased medial joint space combined with sclerotic subchondral bone of the medial tibial plateau, and that's what's in this oval. 00:08:27So we can see that the space here is narrowed. 00:08:31And then we can also see, 00:08:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:35This wide, 00:08:37[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:39Subchondral bone, that wider sclerosis of the subchondral bone is a reparative response to the thinning of the articular cartilage`. 00:08:47And spurs can also result from the repair attempt,  thinning of the articular cartilage`. 00:08:47And spurs can also result from the repair attempt, and on the left side, you can see a white arrow pointing to a spur. 00:08:55Now on the right is an image of osteomyelitis. 00:08:58And this nine-year-old girl had a six-month history of progressive, enlarging soft tissue swelling at the right proximal tibia, and she was diagnosed with osteomyelitis at the proximal tibia. 00:09:11And what you should note here is how the region is well circumscribed by the reactive sclerosis of bone as it attempts to surround and wall off the infected area, and that's what the arrows are. 00:09:22So that really great, great, shiny part there, that's bone reacting and trying to wall off. 00:09:30[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:33And  reacting and trying to wall off. 00:09:30[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:33And in B, the CT axial image further demonstrates that sort of reactive sclerosis of the left tibia, and also reveals the draining effect, and that's the white arrow, which was formed to relieve the pressure of the pus on the bone. 00:09:48And so right here, again, it's very subtle, but you can see that sort of dent right there. 00:09:56So the pus drained out into the soft tissue, which enlarged the circumference of the leg, and that's what we see in this axial view. 00:10:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:10So again, I think the takeaway on the image on the right is just noting how this bone is reactive here, a little brighter as it tries to wall off that area, and especially in the CT down below here. 00:  here, a little brighter as it tries to wall off that area, and especially in the CT down below here. 00:10:24You can really see that brightness. 00:10:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:31So continuing with our ABCDs, we're on C, which is cartilage spaces. 00:10:35So number 1 under C is joint space, and we want to assess the width of the joint spaces. 00:10:41Is the joint space well-preserved with normal thickness of cartilage, disk, tissue, right? 00:10:46Recall from our last slide, you saw on that degenerative change in the medial joint line, that joint space was not well-preserved. 00:10:54And then for number 2, if the space is decreased, that's likely the result of degenerative changes. 00:10:59So a well-preserved joint space implies that the 's likely the result of degenerative changes. 00:10:59So a well-preserved joint space implies that the cartilage or the disk is of normal thickness. 00:11:05And a decreased joint space implies that the cartilage or disk is thinned down as a result of degenerative processes. 00:11:13[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:17So in this slide on the left is degenerative disk disease. 00:11:21An MRI image of a patient with degenerative disk disease, it shows bands of fatty bone marrow parallel to the L5 disk right here. 00:11:32And so we can see this sort of fattiness, and we can see this degenerated disk here. 00:11:39[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:11:48And on the right side, we see degenerative disk disease at the cervical spine. 00:11:53And this lateral view of the cervical  side, we see degenerative disk disease at the cervical spine. 00:11:53And this lateral view of the cervical spine shows the classic hallmarks of degenerative disk disease at C56, including a narrow joint space, an osteophyte formation at the vertebral end plates. 00:12:05And so you can see these little spurs popping up there, these osteophytes. 00:12:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:14I think the important thing I would take away from these two images are looking at the difference here in the joint spaces here, 00:12:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:25And compare that with this joint space, and it's the same on the other image, right? 00:12:29And look here at the joint space, and then we'll compare that with this one. 00:12:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:42  we'll compare that with this one. 00:12:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:42Continuing with cartilage spaces, number 2, the subchondral bone. 00:12:47You want to assess the subchondral bone, looking for changes in density or irregularities. 00:12:54And increased sclerosis could be one finding. 00:12:58For example, in osteoarthritis, the subchondral bone becomes increasingly sclerotic as new bone is formed to help withstand the increased stresses directed at it because of the loss of the articular cartilage. 00:13:10So if you recall from a few slides ago, you could see how those brighter areas of bone were created along that medial femur and tibia, as that joint space became more narrow. 00:13:25Then the other thing to be aware of are erosions. 00:13:28So in rheumat :25Then the other thing to be aware of are erosions. 00:13:28So in rheumatoid arthritis or gout, you see very little reparative sclerosis in the subchondral bone. 00:13:35And instead, you see erosions of the subchondral bone in the form of radiolucencies of the joint margin. 00:13:42And so what that means is that it's very transparent and it's not the right response that we saw with that sclerotic change. 00:13:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:58So in this image, the left hip joint space narrowing reflects the loss of cartilage and changes in bone density and bony irregularities. 00:14:08So osteoarthritis is a destructive joint disease that can result in pain, it can result in stiffness, as well as a loss of range of motion or a loss of activity tolerance.  in pain, it can result in stiffness, as well as a loss of range of motion or a loss of activity tolerance. 00:14:19And X-rays can confirm the diagnosis of osteoarthritis. 00:14:23So X-rays demonstrate a number of findings in osteoarthritis, although they're not always seen, and they can occur in different variations from individual to individual. 00:14:35So the first thing that we see here is joint space narrowing, and that reflects the loss of cartilage. 00:14:41So we can see the joint space narrowing here, and all through the side when you look at that compared with this joint space. 00:14:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:51The second thing that we can see is sclerosis, which is present in almost all cases of osteoarthritis. 00:14:57And again, sclerosis is that brightness that begins to appear here in reaction  of osteoarthritis. 00:14:57And again, sclerosis is that brightness that begins to appear here in reaction to that loss of space and cartilage, right? 00:15:07And look at the amount of brightness there compared to the right big joint. 00:15:14And finally, there's osteophytes present, so a new bone formation around the joint in reaction to that stress. 00:15:21And then subchondral lucency, which is a focal loss of bone density. 00:15:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:15:36Continuing with cartilage spaces, number 3 are the epiphyseal plates. 00:15:40We want to assess the epiphysis, look for changes in the position of the growth plate or the size of the epiphysis, whether the borders are smooth and whether there's presence of disruption or gaps in the plates. 00:15:54So ANK_AUDIO] 00:01:46And on the left, we're looking at the normal density of a proximal femur. 00:01:51And on the right, we're looking at a femur with osteomalacia, so a femur with less density. 00:01:57So note that normal bone density is evident in the increased radiodensity and thickness of the margins of the femoral shaft, and that's where the outlines are here, right? 00:02:08So again, on the outside, we can see that it's more radio dense or brighter, and that's in contrast with the normally lesser radiodensity of the medullary cavity in the center of the bone here. 00:02:21So just like in the last slide, you can see that the center here is less dense than the outsides. 00:02:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:35So osteomalacia on , whether the borders are smooth and whether there's presence of disruption or gaps in the plates. 00:15:54So the position of the growth plate as designated by the relationship of the ossified portion of the secondary epiphysis to the metaphysis. 00:16:03We can see that in figure 221 in your radiology text. 00:16:08And the size of the epiphysis in relation to both the skeletal maturity and the chronological age of the patient has been imaged. 00:16:17Is there's a smooth margin at the borders of the epiphysis, like a band of sclerosis, indicating increased bone activity associated with linear growth? 00:16:27Disruptions in the growth plates from trauma or metabolic disease can be visualized, and those can be difficult to diagnose and they may require contralateral films for comparison. 00:16:37So often, one of the keys in imaging is symmetry, comparing one side to the  for comparison. 00:16:37So often, one of the keys in imaging is symmetry, comparing one side to the other side. 00:16:46[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com4.3 Bone Remodeling and ABCS–A00:00:01So we'll continue with part three, general principles and radiology. 00:00:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:10And our objective in this lecture is to continue with the ABCs of how to begin a radiographic analysis. 00:00:19And in this lecture, we're going to explore bone density and cartilage space. 00:00:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:28So in the ABCDs for B, which stands for bone density, we're looking at number 1 of 3. 00:00:36And number 1  B, which stands for bone density, we're looking at number 1 of 3. 00:00:36And number 1 is skeletal architecture. 00:00:39So the general bone density is what we're looking at here, and we're going to assess the shade of gray, looking for shades of gray and then apply sufficient radiographic contrast between the bone and the soft tissue, and sufficient contrast within the bone itself. 00:00:55So sufficient contrast between the bone and soft tissue, what this means is that healthy bone and soft tissue appear with clearly different or distinct shades of gray. 00:01:06And sufficient contrast within the bone itself means between the denser cortical shell of each bone and the less dense cancerous bone center. 00:01:16And the healthy cortex shows up with greater density than the cancerous bone, and it appears as a white margin along the bone shafts. 00:01:23And so what this means is that if we're  as a white margin along the bone shafts. 00:01:23And so what this means is that if we're looking at a long bone, the outside of the bone here, the edges will appear bright and the insides here will appear less bright. 00:01:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:46And on the left, we're looking at the normal density of a proximal femur. 00:01:51And on the right, we're looking at a femur with osteomalacia, so a femur with less density. 00:01:57So note that normal bone density is evident in the increased radiodensity and thickness of the margins of the femoral shaft, and that's where the outlines are here, right? 00:02:08So again, on the outside, we can see that it's more radio dense or brighter, and that's in contrast with the normally lesser radiodensity of the medull  that it's more radio dense or brighter, and that's in contrast with the normally lesser radiodensity of the medullary cavity in the center of the bone here. 00:02:21So just like in the last slide, you can see that the center here is less dense than the outsides. 00:02:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:35So osteomalacia on the slide on the right, that's also known as adult rickets, and this is a hypocalcification disorder, so less bone. 00:02:45As seen in this proximal femur, the body is able to produce bone, but it's not able to calcify it. 00:02:51So the result is a very wide but a porous femur, and the classic radiologic finding is a looser zone. 00:02:59A radiolucent band, which is transverse to the cortex, and it's an . 00:02:59A radiolucent band, which is transverse to the cortex, and it's an insufficiency stress fracture related to the demineralized cortex. 00:03:08And the slight increased radiodensity on either side of the fracture line is the bone's attempt to repair that area of stress. 00:03:16And so one of the things you'll notice with imaging is that often, the things that you're looking for are really subtle, and so it's right in between those red lines, we can see that. 00:03:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:30I think the most important thing I'll have you take away from this slide was really the brightness of the outer edges of the bone on the left image, that healthy femur, and the less dense center of the femur. 00:03:44And then on the right image, noticing how transparent or darker that femur  of the femur. 00:03:44And then on the right image, noticing how transparent or darker that femur is versus the healthy femur on the left. 00:03:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:57So number 2 under bone density is textural abnormalities. 00:04:02And we're going to look for changes in appearance of the trabeculae, and changes in mineralization, which result in changes in the appearance of the trabeculae. 00:04:12And so when the mineralization of the bone is altered, the appearance of the trabeculae is also altered. 00:04:17So the altered trabeculae appearance is often a radiologic hallmark in the diagnosis of disease processes. 00:04:24The image of the trabeculae is often described in terms like textures such as thin or delicate, or [UNKNOWN], smudge, or eculae is often described in terms like textures such as thin or delicate, or [UNKNOWN], smudge, or fluffy. 00:04:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:39So in this slide, the picture on the left is decalcification due to hyperparathyroidism. 00:04:46And on the right, we have cortical thinning as a result of Cooley's anemia. 00:04:51So on the left, this is a previously healthy 21-year-old man who'd been troubled for the last 18 months by progressive loss of strength in his legs. 00:05:02And he was found to have primary hyperparathyroidism due to a tumor of the parathyroid. 00:05:09And the radiograph of his leg shows these generalized skeletal changes with considerable decalcification of the bones and erosions of the cortex. 00:05:19And so we  with considerable decalcification of the bones and erosions of the cortex. 00:05:19And so we can see here, if we look at the tibia, even the cortex, and we can see what we're looking for is this sort of straight line, and we're not seeing that, right, we're sort of seeing these edges that are kind of rough. 00:05:34And then even within the texture of the inside of the bone here is just normal translucent. 00:05:43And on the right, what we're looking at is this lacy appearance of the trabeculae of the upper extremity of this child due to Cooley's anemia, and that's an inherited blood disorder that results in destruction of red blood cells. 00:05:59The metacarpals and the phalanges show cortical thickening and osteopenia. 00:06:05And marrow proliferation results in a loss of normal tub anges show cortical thickening and osteopenia. 00:06:05And marrow proliferation results in a loss of normal tubulation, which results in a squared or sausage shape of the bones in the hand. 00:06:14And so if you look at the metacarpals here on this hand, you can see then as opposed to the normal shape, right, they're sort of off. 00:06:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:28And the other thing we're looking at in this image is this lacy appearance of the inside of the bones here, of the trabeculae. 00:06:37[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:43So number 3 under bone density is local density changes. 00:06:48And so we're assessing for localized changes in the bone density. 00:06:51So we're looking for increases in bone density in weight-bearing areas, like sclerosis,  outsides. 00:02:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:35So osteomalacia on the slide on the right, that's also known as adult rickets, and this is a hypocalcification disorder, so less bone. 00:02:45As seen in this proximal femur, the body is able to produce bone, but it's not able to calcify it. 00:02:51So the result is a very wide but a porous femur, and the classic radiologic finding is a looser zone. 00:02:59A radiolucent band, which is transverse to the cortex, and it's an insufficiency stress fracture related to the demineralized cortex. 00:03:08And the slight increased radiodensity on either side of the fracture line is the bone's attempt to repair that area of stress. 00:03:16And so one of the things you'll notice with  density. 00:06:51So we're looking for increases in bone density in weight-bearing areas, like sclerosis, as well as excessive increases in osteoarthritic conditions and reactive changes, which occur when the body acts to contain a diseased area. 00:07:06So sclerosis or normal increases in bone density are seen in areas that are subjected to increased physical stress, such as the weight-bearing areas of joints. 00:07:17These areas of localized sclerosis are actually signs of repair, where extra bone is deposited to fortify the bony architecture to withstand the forces of weight-bearing. 00:07:29Excessive sclerosis, that can be normal, so when bone is healing, it forms a callus as if remodeled, but it can also occur during degenerative changes such as arthritis. 00:07:44And reactive sclerosis, that occurs during conditions such as reaction to a tumor or cancer, and the body may lay down bone as it attempts  sclerosis, that occurs during conditions such as reaction to a tumor or cancer, and the body may lay down bone as it attempts to surround and contain the diseased area. 00:07:56[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:00So in this slide on the left, we're looking at degenerative changes of the medial knee. 00:08:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:09And so in this AP view of the knee, what you should see is this classic radiographic hallmark of arthritis, which is demonstrated by decreased medial joint space combined with sclerotic subchondral bone of the medial tibial plateau, and that's what's in this oval. 00:08:27So we can see that the space here is narrowed. 00:08:31And then we can also see, 00:08:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:35This wide, 00:08:37[ :08:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:35This wide, 00:08:37[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:39Subchondral bone, that wider sclerosis of the subchondral bone is a reparative response to the thinning of the articular cartilage`. 00:08:47And spurs can also result from the repair attempt, and on the left side, you can see a white arrow pointing to a spur. 00:08:55Now on the right is an image of osteomyelitis. 00:08:58And this nine-year-old girl had a six-month history of progressive, enlarging soft tissue swelling at the right proximal tibia, and she was diagnosed with osteomyelitis at the proximal tibia. 00:09:11And what you should note here is how the region is well circumscribed by the reactive sclerosis of bone as it attempts to 11And what you should note here is how the region is well circumscribed by the reactive sclerosis of bone as it attempts to surround and wall off the infected area, and that's what the arrows are. 00:09:22So that really great, great, shiny part there, that's bone reacting and trying to wall off. 00:09:30[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:33And in B, the CT axial image further demonstrates that sort of reactive sclerosis of the left tibia, and also reveals the draining effect, and that's the white arrow, which was formed to relieve the pressure of the pus on the bone. 00:09:48And so right here, again, it's very subtle, but you can see that sort of dent right there. 00:09:56So the pus drained out into the soft tissue, which enlarged the circumference of the leg, and that's what we see in this axial view. 00:10  tissue, which enlarged the circumference of the leg, and that's what we see in this axial view. 00:10:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:10So again, I think the takeaway on the image on the right is just noting how this bone is reactive here, a little brighter as it tries to wall off that area, and especially in the CT down below here. 00:10:24You can really see that brightness. 00:10:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:31So continuing with our ABCDs, we're on C, which is cartilage spaces. 00:10:35So number 1 under C is joint space, and we want to assess the width of the joint spaces. 00:10:41Is the joint space well-preserved with normal thickness of cartilage, disk, tissue, right? 00:10:46Recall from our last slide, you saw on that degenerative , disk, tissue, right? 00:10:46Recall from our last slide, you saw on that degenerative change in the medial joint line, that joint space was not well-preserved. 00:10:54And then for number 2, if the space is decreased, that's likely the result of degenerative changes. 00:10:59So a well-preserved joint space implies that the cartilage or the disk is of normal thickness. 00:11:05And a decreased joint space implies that the cartilage or disk is thinned down as a result of degenerative processes. 00:11:13[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:17So in this slide on the left is degenerative disk disease. 00:11:21An MRI image of a patient with degenerative disk disease, it shows bands of fatty bone marrow parallel to the L5 disk right here. 00:11:32And so we can see this sort of  fatty bone marrow parallel to the L5 disk right here. 00:11:32And so we can see this sort of fattiness, and we can see this degenerated disk here. 00:11:39[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:11:48And on the right side, we see degenerative disk disease at the cervical spine. 00:11:53And this lateral view of the cervical spine shows the classic hallmarks of degenerative disk disease at C56, including a narrow joint space, an osteophyte formation at the vertebral end plates. 00:12:05And so you can see these little spurs popping up there, these osteophytes. 00:12:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:14I think the important thing I would take away from these two images are looking at the difference here in the joint spaces here, 00:12:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:25  difference here in the joint spaces here, 00:12:23[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:25And compare that with this joint space, and it's the same on the other image, right? 00:12:29And look here at the joint space, and then we'll compare that with this one. 00:12:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:42Continuing with cartilage spaces, number 2, the subchondral bone. 00:12:47You want to assess the subchondral bone, looking for changes in density or irregularities. 00:12:54And increased sclerosis could be one finding. 00:12:58For example, in osteoarthritis, the subchondral bone becomes increasingly sclerotic as new bone is formed to help withstand the increased stresses directed at it because of the loss of the articular cartilage. 00:13:10So if you recall from a  directed at it because of the loss of the articular cartilage. 00:13:10So if you recall from a few slides ago, you could see how those brighter areas of bone were created along that medial femur and tibia, as that joint space became more narrow. 00:13:25Then the other thing to be aware of are erosions. 00:13:28So in rheumatoid arthritis or gout, you see very little reparative sclerosis in the subchondral bone. 00:13:35And instead, you see erosions of the subchondral bone in the form of radiolucencies of the joint margin. 00:13:42And so what that means is that it's very transparent and it's not the right response that we saw with that sclerotic change. 00:13:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:58So in this image, the left hip joint space 13:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:58So in this image, the left hip joint space narrowing reflects the loss of cartilage and changes in bone density and bony irregularities. 00:14:08So osteoarthritis is a destructive joint disease that can result in pain, it can result in stiffness, as well as a loss of range of motion or a loss of activity tolerance. 00:14:19And X-rays can confirm the diagnosis of osteoarthritis. 00:14:23So X-rays demonstrate a number of findings in osteoarthritis, although they're not always seen, and they can occur in different variations from individual to individual. 00:14:35So the first thing that we see here is joint space narrowing, and that reflects the loss of cartilage. 00:14:41So we can see the joint space narrowing here, and all through the side when you look at that compared with this joint space  bone's attempt to repair that area of stress. 00:03:16And so one of the things you'll notice with imaging is that often, the things that you're looking for are really subtle, and so it's right in between those red lines, we can see that. 00:03:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:30I think the most important thing I'll have you take away from this slide was really the brightness of the outer edges of the bone on the left image, that healthy femur, and the less dense center of the femur. 00:03:44And then on the right image, noticing how transparent or darker that femur is versus the healthy femur on the left. 00:03:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:57So number 2 under bone density is textural abnormalities. 00:04:02And we're going to look for changes in appearance of the trabeculae So we can see the joint space narrowing here, and all through the side when you look at that compared with this joint space. 00:14:48[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:51The second thing that we can see is sclerosis, which is present in almost all cases of osteoarthritis. 00:14:57And again, sclerosis is that brightness that begins to appear here in reaction to that loss of space and cartilage, right? 00:15:07And look at the amount of brightness there compared to the right big joint. 00:15:14And finally, there's osteophytes present, so a new bone formation around the joint in reaction to that stress. 00:15:21And then subchondral lucency, which is a focal loss of bone density. 00:15:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:15:36Continuing with cartilage spaces, number 3 are the epiphyse ANK_AUDIO] 00:15:36Continuing with cartilage spaces, number 3 are the epiphyseal plates. 00:15:40We want to assess the epiphysis, look for changes in the position of the growth plate or the size of the epiphysis, whether the borders are smooth and whether there's presence of disruption or gaps in the plates. 00:15:54So the position of the growth plate as designated by the relationship of the ossified portion of the secondary epiphysis to the metaphysis. 00:16:03We can see that in figure 221 in your radiology text. 00:16:08And the size of the epiphysis in relation to both the skeletal maturity and the chronological age of the patient has been imaged. 00:16:17Is there's a smooth margin at the borders of the epiphysis, like a band of sclerosis, indicating increased bone activity associated with linear growth? 00:  the borders of the epiphysis, like a band of sclerosis, indicating increased bone activity associated with linear growth? 00:16:27Disruptions in the growth plates from trauma or metabolic disease can be visualized, and those can be difficult to diagnose and they may require contralateral films for comparison. 00:16:37So often, one of the keys in imaging is symmetry, comparing one side to the other side. 00:16:46[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com ural abnormalities. 00:04:02And we're going to look for changes in appearance of the trabeculae, and changes in mineralization, which result in changes in the appearance of the trabeculae. 00:04:12And so when the mineralization of the bone is altered, the appearance of the trabeculae is also altered. 00:04:17So the altered trabeculae appearance is often a radiologic hallmark in the diagnosis of disease processes. 00:04:24The image of the trabeculae is often described in terms like textures such as thin or delicate, or [UNKNOWN], smudge, or fluffy. 00:04:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:39So in this slide, the picture on the left is decalcification due to hyperparathyroidism. 00:04:46And on the right, we have cortical thinning as a result  to hyperparathyroidism. 00:04:46And on the right, we have cortical thinning as a result of Cooley's anemia. 00:04:51So on the left, this is a previously healthy 21-year-old man who'd been troubled for the last 18 months by progressive loss of strength in his legs. 00:05:02And he was found to have primary hyperparathyroidism due to a tumor of the parathyroid. 00:05:09And the radiograph of his leg shows these generalized skeletal changes with considerable decalcification of the bones and erosions of the cortex. 00:05:19And so we can see here, if we look at the tibia, even the cortex, and we can see what we're looking for is this sort of straight line, and we're not seeing that, right, we're sort of seeing these edges that are kind of rough. 00:05:34And  not seeing that, right, we're sort of seeing these edges that are kind of rough. 00:05:34And then even within the texture of the inside of the bone here is just normal translucent. 00:05:43And on the right, what we're looking at is this lacy appearance of the trabeculae of the upper extremity of this child due to Cooley's anemia, and that's an inherited blood disorder that results in destruction of red blood cells. 00:05:59The metacarpals and the phalanges show cortical thickening and osteopenia. 00:06:05And marrow proliferation results in a loss of normal tubulation, which results in a squared or sausage shape of the bones in the hand. 00:06:14And so if you look at the metacarpals here on this hand, you can see then as opposed to the normal shape, right, they're sort of off. 00:06  this hand, you can see then as opposed to the normal shape, right, they're sort of off. 00:06:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:28And the other thing we're looking at in this image is this lacy appearance of the inside of the bones here, of the trabeculae. 00:06:37[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:43So number 3 under bone density is local density changes. 00:06:48And so we're assessing for localized changes in the bone density. 00:06:51So we're looking for increases in bone density in weight-bearing areas, like sclerosis, as well as excessive increases in osteoarthritic conditions and reactive changes, which occur when the body acts to contain a diseased area. 00:07:06So sclerosis or normal increases in bone density are seen in areas that are subjected to increased physical stress, such as the weight-bearing areas  or normal increases in bone density are seen in areas that are subjected to increased physical stress, such as the weight-bearing areas of joints. 00:07:17These areas of localized sclerosis are actually signs of repair, where extra bone is deposited to fortify the bony architecture to withstand the forces of weight-bearing. 00:07:29Excessive sclerosis, that can be normal, so when bone is healing, it forms a callus as if remodeled, but it can also occur during degenerative changes such as arthritis. 00:07:44And reactive sclerosis, that occurs during conditions such as reaction to a tumor or cancer, and the body may lay down bone as it attempts to surround and contain the diseased area. 00:07:56[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:00So in this slide on the left, we're looking at degenerative changes of the medial knee. 00:08:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00: 4.4 ABCs–Soft Tissue00:00:00So lecture 4.4. 00:00:03We're going to continue along with our general principles and radiology. 00:00:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:10And our objective here is to continue with our ABCS radiographic analysis. 00:00:17And we've gotten through A and B and C alignment, bone and cartilage. 00:00:22Now we're on soft tissues, S. 00:00:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:28But before we get to our soft tissues, I want to backtrack a little bit to our last lecture, where we were talking about the epiphysis. 00:00:36And the Salter-Harris classification system addresses physeal fractures. 00:00:41On the left we have a type IV fracture of the distal tibia, and on the . 00:00:41On the left we have a type IV fracture of the distal tibia, and on the right we have normal epiphyseal plates. 00:00:48So here's an image of a patient who presented with ankle pain after being tackled while playing rugby. 00:00:54And this is a Salter-Harris type IV, where the fracture passes through the metaphysis, the growth plate and the epiphysis. 00:01:03And so, it's really faint again, you can see it's recording right here 00:01:13[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:18And so, this is referred to as a triplane fracture, and they tend to occur at the distal tibia. 00:01:24So, on the right is a normal radiographic appearance of a hand of an 8-year old child, and the borders of the epiphyses are normally bounded by a  the contour of the skin here. 00:07:49You can see how it's kind of pushed out, and that's a result of the fluid accumulation here, between the blood and the femur. 00:07:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:01And the soft tissue. 00:08:02[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:11So, continuing with soft tissues, number 4 is periosteum. 00:08:14And the periosteum is assessed for any kind of reactive process, so a solid reaction for fracture healing or osteomyelitis. 00:08:23A laminated process due to repetitive injury, a sunburst as a result of malignancy, or a Codman's triangle due to a tumor, hemorrhage or other trauma. 00:08:34So, normally, rather than distinct, the periosteum can become evident in its response to :08:34So, normally, rather than distinct, the periosteum can become evident in its response to abnormal conditions. 00:08:41And you can actually see this in your McKenna's textbook, figure 2 dash 26. 00:08:47And a periosteal reaction is generally described as being one of four types, and by the characteristic radiographic images. 00:08:56So, look for these types of periosteal reaction. 00:08:58A solid Is a reaction that indicates an indolent or slow rolling process which is seen in fracture healing, in chronic osteomyelitis, laminated or onionskin kind of shape or outline, and this reaction indicates repetitive injury. 00:09:18As in battered child syndrome, it's also associated with sarcomas, a sunburst or speculated pattern. 00:09:26So, this reaction is almost always associated with malignant bone lesions such as sarcomas  pattern. 00:09:26So, this reaction is almost always associated with malignant bone lesions such as sarcomas, and is frequently seen in metastatic squamous cell tumors. 00:09:36The distinct appearance of the periosteum is due to the repeated breakthrough of the tumor, the neoplastic process, followed by a new periosteal response. 00:09:48And finally, Codman's triangle, where a piece of the periosteum is elevated by abnormal conditions and it ossifies in a triangular shape. 00:09:56And this can be present in a variety of conditions, including a tumor, a subperiosteal hemorrhage in battered child syndrome. 00:10:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:11And periosteal reactions to abnormal conditions appear on radiograph in four characteristic images, all right? 00:10:18The solid and the sunburst here  conditions appear on radiograph in four characteristic images, all right? 00:10:18The solid and the sunburst here, and then the onionskin, we have these layers, right? 00:10:28And finally Codman's triangle. 00:10:29So, the Codman's triangle, it might be helpful to imagine you have your bone here and something kind of pushes that bone out, and continues to push it out like this. 00:10:41[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:43And it develops into a triangle shape. 00:10:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:52So, soft tissue is number 5, miscellaneous soft tissue findings. 00:10:57We assess for out-of-the-ordinary soft tissue findings. 00:11:00So, gas as a result of gangrene or trauma, calcification, or foreign bodies. 00:11:07So, gas  gas as a result of gangrene or trauma, calcification, or foreign bodies. 00:11:07So, gas in soft tissue is an indication of gas forming organisms such as gangrene or trauma, and calcifications in soft tissues can be the result of cold trauma where a hemorrhage is coagulated and calcified. 00:11:21Calcifications also occur in vessels and organs, for example, renal calculi or gallstones, or calcifications in the abdominal or the organs, those can be seen on radiographs. 00:11:33And finally, things like foreign bodies, such as metal shards, you can also see those on soft tissues on radiographs. 00:11:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:44So in this image, we're looking at myositis, ossificans of the elbow and forearm. 00:11:49This is an AP view of the elbow, and heterotopic bone is  the elbow and forearm. 00:11:49This is an AP view of the elbow, and heterotopic bone is developed in the soft tissues of a forearm of this 53-year old man after a biceps tendon tear, and a repair with a Mitek suture anchor. 00:12:04So, the boundaries of that abnormal tissue are here. 00:12:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:13Okay, this is the heterotopic bone, and then here, you can see some hardware, right in there. 00:12:25[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com  of a hand of an 8-year old child, and the borders of the epiphyses are normally bounded by a smooth margin with a band of sclerosis indicating increased bone activity. 00:01:38And so, that's fine, that is a really nice one, because you can see how great that is right there. 00:01:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:48And this is how they're distinguished from fracture fragments, with that really, really bright band of sclerosis from the increased bone activity, all right? 00:01:58So now, we'll get back to soft tissues from our ABCS. 00:02:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:06So, under soft tissues, number one is muscles, and we can assess the soft tissue of the muscles, looking for changes in muscle girth that might represent muscle wasting or gross swelling of muscle and soft tissues. 00:02:18And so  in muscle girth that might represent muscle wasting or gross swelling of muscle and soft tissues. 00:02:18And so, although tissue densities appear similar on radiographs, because tissue has limited density compared with bone. 00:02:26In extreme circumstances, some properties of the soft tissue can actually be visualized, and gross muscle wasting could suggest a primary muscle disease paralysis, or some sort of severe illness or disuse attribute is secondary to trauma 00:02:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:48Gross swelling for example of muscles and soft tissues could also be indicative of inflammation or edema, hemorrhage, or tumor. 00:02:58So essentially, looking at the size or the girth of the muscle can be indicative of different pathologies. 00:03:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:09So, in this image, we're looking at disuse atrophy of the quadriceps, and :03:09So, in this image, we're looking at disuse atrophy of the quadriceps, and this is disuse atrophy of the quadriceps secondary to a traumatic patellar dislocation. 00:03:20And you can see the shrunken and concave appearance of the soft tissue outlining the thigh. 00:03:26Look at the inferior position of the patella related to the quadriceps insufficiency, right? 00:03:32And so, here on the other leg, this is the normal patella position. 00:03:38And on the right side, you can see it's really free. 00:03:41You can see how the patella was dropped down there. 00:03:44And also, even more there, and you can see the bulk of the quads here on this one. 00:03:52You can see it's all these. 00:03  of the quads here on this one. 00:03:52You can see it's all these. 00:03:55[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:57Okay. 00:03:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:00This is a really excellent drawing. 00:04:01Bob Ross-like drawing, I suppose. 00:04:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:11So, continuing with our soft tissues. 00:04:12Number 2 is fat pads, and we want to assess the fat pads looking for changes in the position of the fat pads. 00:04:20And this is usually a result of swelling and possibly an injury to an adjacent structure. 00:04:25So, although soft tissue densities may appear similar, again, we're looking more at girth or maybe location of soft tissue on one extremity compared to another extremity. 00:04 're looking more at girth or maybe location of soft tissue on one extremity compared to another extremity. 00:04:40[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:44So, in this image, on the left, we're looking at a normal pronator quadratus fat pad. 00:04:51And on the right, we're looking at anterior bowing of the pronator quadratus fat pad. 00:04:58So, on lateral wrist radiographs, the pronator fat pad usually appears as a thin, radiolucent triangle with its base attached to the palmar surface of the distal radius. 00:05:10And the bowing on the right could be the result of a fall, a muscle strain, an inflammatory condition or infection, or septic arthritis at the wrist, but that bowing is a result of fluid. 00:05:25So, you can see how it kind of bulges out there owing is a result of fluid. 00:05:25So, you can see how it kind of bulges out there, as opposed to this side, and it's pretty straight 00:05:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:44So, continuing with soft tissues, number 3 is joint capsule, we want to assess the joint capsule. 00:05:49Usually you can't see these well, but they become visible when swelling is present. 00:05:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:55And so that swelling is seen and exacerbations of arthritic conditions, like infection or hemophilia, and acute joint trauma. 00:06:05Effusion from the trauma and intra articular fracture may produce a lipohemarthrosis in the joint capsule, and a lipohemarthrosis is the mixture of fat and blood from the marrow, which enters the joint space through an osteochondral hemarthrosis is the mixture of fat and blood from the marrow, which enters the joint space through an osteochondral defect. 00:06:22And so because fat is less dense than blood, the fat floats on the surface of the blood. 00:06:27On a radiograph, this is referred to as a fat fluid level or a fat-blood interface, FBI sign fat-blood interface. 00:06:39And somewhat seen on a radiograph it's a sign or a strong indicator for potentially overlooked intra articular fracture. 00:06:46[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:51So, this is the fat-blood interface sign, the FBI sign, and this is a non-weight-bearing lateral view of the knee, and marrow and blood that seep through the intra-articular tibial patella fracture, which we can't see here. 00:07:08It has accumulated in the suprap ial patella fracture, which we can't see here. 00:07:08It has accumulated in the suprapatellar area of the joint capsule, and divided into layers because of differences in fluid density. 00:07:17And a fracture has to occur for this sign to be present. 00:07:21[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:25So, I think a couple of important things we need to recognize. 00:07:28Number one, we have the joint space here between the tibia and the femur, and the we have the patella here. 00:07:34And then note the difference in the densities here, you can see the fat and the blood interface. 00:07:41But the other thing I think that's important to recognize is that, if we look at the contour of the skin here. 00:07:49You can see how it's kind of pushed out, and 4.5 Skeletal Pathology–Categories, Distribution, Predictors00:00:01So, we're going to continue with 4.5, Moral and General Principles in Radiology, 00:00:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:11And the objectives of this lecture are to identify categories of skeletal pathology. 00:00:17And provide examples of each, and identify the different distributions of skeletal pathology and provide examples of each. 00:00:24And finally, identify predictor variables of different skeletal pathology, and provide examples of each. 00:00:35So radiologic diagnosis of skeletal pathology. 00:00:39So skeletal pathology can be organized for diagnosis by identifying the category of pathology, distribution of the lesion, and the predictive variables that characterize the disease features. 00:00:52So in the picture on the right is a 54 year old with benign osteochondromas and the proximal humerus be you can  picture on the right is a 54 year old with benign osteochondromas and the proximal humerus be you can see that. 00:01:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:09See that right here? 00:01:12And this is sort of orient yourself, right? 00:01:15[INAUDIBLE] Okay. 00:01:21So in the proximal humerus and then in the proximal and distal femur C. 00:01:28And so here's our femur, 00:01:30[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:37So we can see that it's sort of a funny shape there. 00:01:40[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:43All right, and then also in the proximal tibia, D. 00:01:47And so, down here is our tibia, again, in a really funny  during certain periods of time versus inadequate nutrition during other periods of time. 00:08:35Again, that sort of white space here, I guess that's for those [INAUDIBLE]. 00:08:39[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:47So once we've identified the category, now we want to identify the distribution of the lesion and whether it's a monoarticular such as a fracture affecting only one bone or joint. 00:08:59Polyarticular, such as rheumatoid arthritis, which can affect multiple bones or joints, or diffuse, such as osteoporosis or bony metastases, which can affect all or nearly all the bones or joints, like neoplastic and metabolic disease. 00:09:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:20So here's a diffuse distribution and this is metastases and we can see why spread sclerosis. 00:09:27So again, sclerosis is  diffuse distribution and this is metastases and we can see why spread sclerosis. 00:09:27So again, sclerosis is this increased bone density that increase brightness of the pelvis and the sacroiliac region. 00:09:34And the vertebral bodies of the thoracic and lumbar spine appear of sclerotic with a loss of the pedicles bilaterally. 00:09:50And so you can sort of see, really distinct, whichever bodies looks like there's just nothing attached to them. 00:10:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:05So now we're going to identify some predictor variables that suggest seeing table to dashboard in your McInnes text for some additional information. 00:10:17So the behavior of the lesion, is it osteolytic or osteoblastic or next? 00:10:24And so we may see geographic destruction of areas of bone that become destroyed or moth eaten appearance where ? 00:10:24And so we may see geographic destruction of areas of bone that become destroyed or moth eaten appearance where there are small holes and ragged borders. 00:10:35Or we might see permeative destruction, where there's very fine destruction through the conversion system of the bone. 00:10:42Possibly requiring magnification to see, might suggest a malignant lesion. 00:10:48Is it osteoblastic, where we have reparative or reactive bone formation, or is it mixed? 00:10:55Number two, the bone or joint involved. 00:10:57So some diseases affect certain bones characteristically. 00:11:01Gout and rheumatoid arthritis usually affect the small joints of the hands and feet, while osteoarthritis will affect the knees. 00:11:09And then the locus within a bone. 00:11:11So certain tumors are going to arise in the diat And then the locus within a bone. 00:11:11So certain tumors are going to arise in the diathesis, while others will occur in the physioregion or the metaphysioregion. 00:11:19And osteoarthritis is going to affect the weight-bearing areas, the age, the gender, and the race of the patient. 00:11:28So the age could be a risk factor for certain tumors And gender may be a risk factor for others. 00:11:34Rheumatoid arthritis, for example may affect females more often than males, as yeas will be likely just the opposite where males are affected more often than females. 00:11:45And then the margin of revision explanation was sharply defined or as a poorly defined A. 00:11:51Sharply defined lesion is usually indicative of a slow-growing lesion, while a poorly defined margin of lesion is generally associated with a ion is usually indicative of a slow-growing lesion, while a poorly defined margin of lesion is generally associated with a lesion that's more aggressive. 00:12:01And then the shape of a lesion. 00:12:04So if the shape is longer than wide, it's generally a slow-growing lesion. 00:12:09And if the shape is wider than it is long, it's generally an aggressive. 00:12:15And the joint space, is the joint space crossed, or is the joint space preserved? 00:12:21And tumors don't usually cross the joint space or the growth space. 00:12:24On the other hand, infections and inflammatory processes has instructions on both sides of the choice. 00:12:32And then number eight bony reaction. 00:12:35So periosteal reaction is characterized by interrupted for uninterrupted with interrupted suggesting some kind of malignant or aggressive lesion. So periosteal reaction is characterized by interrupted for uninterrupted with interrupted suggesting some kind of malignant or aggressive lesion. 00:12:47Uninterrupted usually suggests that benign, usually solid density kind of [UNKNOWN] The presentation of an interrupted pattern could be sunburst onion scan or the [UNKNOWN] as we saw in prior slides. 00:13:05We could also see sclerosis or what's called I want to say we have this exostoses or osteophytes at the billing emergency. 00:13:14Number nine matrix production, and the matrix is the tissue produced by the primary bone and neoplasms. 00:13:22So we can have osteoid where it's bony and it appears white clouds light and fluffy density. 00:13:30Conjoined with more cartilaginous appearing or popcorn life and then we could also have a mixed in soft tissue changes. 00:13:39We could see that edema or haem  we could also have a mixed in soft tissue changes. 00:13:39We could see that edema or haemorrhage or joint effusion displacement of fat pads or fat lines. 00:13:46Remember the s of our ABCs, infections or inflammation, which adds density to the soft tissue. 00:13:55Finally, a history of trauma or surgery number 11. 00:13:59A history of pain related to activity may help differentiate between a stress fracture and a malignant bone tumor. 00:14:06An odd bone impairment could be related to a history of surgery. 00:14:11So, a number of different predictive variables and again, for this I'd suggest referring back to table 2 dash 4, and you are McKenna's text. 00:14:20[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com o24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com ibia, D. 00:01:47And so, down here is our tibia, again, in a really funny shape. 00:01:52[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:02And so, if we identify the category of the pathology, the category here is neoplastic, or identifying the distribution of the lesion. 00:02:11The distribution is diffuse, all right, so we can see that it's throughout the body. 00:02:18And then the predictor variables are osteoblastic. 00:02:22You can see that it creates me a bone if you look up in B, right and see this new bone here. 00:02:28If we look at the femur here, you can see that femurs made a new bone if we look at the tibia here, you can see that the tibia has created a new bone here. 00:02:37And in terms of location, it  can see that the tibia has created a new bone here. 00:02:37And in terms of location, it's usually located around the knee of the distal femur and the proximal humerus, and that's what we see in the images in this patient. 00:02:49It's usually in the metaphysis or the diaphysis. 00:02:53It occurs in men more than women. 00:02:55And then it's sharply defined, it's a slow growing lesion. 00:03:02[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:04And then the shape is usually longer than it is wide. 00:03:08And that's sort of what we see here too again, if you look at B, right, this is sort of a long [INAUDIBLE] But it can also be broad based triggers for like growth. 00:03:25A really important one here though is that the  it can also be broad based triggers for like growth. 00:03:25A really important one here though is that the joint space is usually preserved, right? 00:03:30And so we look here at this femural joint. 00:03:33We still have space in there if we look between the tibia and the femur, we still have space in there, you can see that space here too. 00:03:45And the bony reaction, it's, it's usually encompassed by a cartilage cap. 00:03:51And finally, the matrix production is mixed and there's no soft tissue changes and no history of trauma or surgery. 00:03:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:05So when we think about, again, the radiologic diagnosis of skeletal pathology, we're looking at number one, identifying the category of the methodology. 00:04:15The different categories include, for example,  looking at number one, identifying the category of the methodology. 00:04:15The different categories include, for example, congenital, right from birth, so the presence of a cervical rib, inflammatory having to do with vascular structure, osteomyelitis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, metabolic, such as Paget's disease or fibrous dryplasia. 00:04:37Aa neoplastic category like a bone tumor, a traumatic category like a broken bone fractured, a vascular category such as avascular necrosis or fever, and then finally a miscellaneous or other, which can include things like an infection or osteoarthritis. 00:04:55[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:00So as we look at the categories, we'll start here with the inflammatory category. 00:05:05And what we're looking at in this slide is ankylosing spondylitis. 00:05:10And And what we're looking at in this slide is ankylosing spondylitis. 00:05:10And both of these images are from a 66 year old man on the left, the ossification of the outer fibers of the disc. 00:05:19The amylose fibrosis and the alpophaseal joints have fused, so we can see the ossification of the outer fibers of the disc here, and the other thing that's. 00:05:38Here's a look at this bonding activity here. 00:05:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:44On the right, ligamentous ossifications and you can also see fusion of the apophyseal and sacroiliac joints. 00:05:52Usually, there's more dark appearing cartilage, but that's been replaced by bone matrix. 00:05:58You can see that in the red arrow here. 00:  that's been replaced by bone matrix. 00:05:58You can see that in the red arrow here. 00:06:01And then like your takeaway from the right which is really just the amount of bone that's present, the amount of bright image that's present in this picture. 00:06:11And we can just see 00:06:12[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:16That much of a gap in here or here too, and we don't see a lot of smoothness when you see a lot of [UNKNOWN] Going matrix, 00:06:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:32So the next category we're going to look at is the metabolic category, sample here is nutritional rickets. 00:06:42And so what we're looking at in these images is nutritional rickets and a femoral fracture in a three year old female. 00:06:50So on the left  is nutritional rickets and a femoral fracture in a three year old female. 00:06:50So on the left we have AP radiograph of both knees, and we can see a fracture of the distal right femur with a black arrow right here, and if you remember our ABCs. 00:07:02The alignment here is off, so this is not very well aligned. 00:07:11We can also see fractures of the right tibia and both fibula, and that's at the dashed white pearls right down here. 00:07:20And you can see this one down here [INAUDIBLE] We can also see this sort of fragmented or frayed and fractured metaphyses, and that's at the solid white arrows here. 00:07:35So we can see this just doesn't look very distinct and solid, it's kind of hanging off to the side here. 00:07:42Same with this one over here  and solid, it's kind of hanging off to the side here. 00:07:42Same with this one over here. 00:07:45So the image on the right is the same individual two years later. 00:07:50And you can see this sort of diffuse osteopenia, as you can see following the tibia, right here, and you can see following the fibula here. 00:08:03We can also see widened growth plates here, 00:08:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:09And we can see the sclerosis and irregularity on metapasis. 00:08:13The arrows point to the sclerotic metaphysial bands due to alternating periods of adequate and inadequate mineralization. 00:08:23That may be due to or related to the adequacy of nutrition during certain periods of time versus inadequate nutrition during other periods of time. 00:08:35Again, that sort of white 4.6 The Radiologic Report00:00:01So we'll continue our discussion on general principles in radiology with lecture 4.6 here. 00:00:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:11The objectives for this portion include to describe the purposes of the radiologic report. 00:00:19Define the 4 D's sequential tasks used in radiologist reporting. 00:00:26Describe the components of a typical radiology report. 00:00:29And number 4, explain two ways a physical therapist might help a patient feel more comfortable or satisfied with their imaging results. 00:00:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:42So we'll start with the radiology report. 00:00:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:49So the purposes of the radiologic report, first to link the radiologic signs with the patient history and the examination findings, and then  purposes of the radiologic report, first to link the radiologic signs with the patient history and the examination findings, and then to provide a comparison with earlier or later radiological examinations, to have a permanent record. 00:01:06And the report supports the treatment through identified indications and contraindications for the medical intervention. 00:01:14And the report can be used for research, and it also facilitates communication. 00:01:19Usually, the report contains information about the patient demographics and imaging findings, and a conclusion along with the radiologist's name and signature. 00:01:29[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:35So the 4 Ds, radiologists are trained in the 4 Ds of radiology reporting, and they're the basic sequential tests performed when the radiologist reads a case. 00:01:47And the 4 Ds are to detect, describe, diagnose, or differential diagnosis, and make a decision. 00  is failure to note the second fracture. 00:08:25And so they find the first fracture and stop looking. 00:08:29Other ones that I think that are kind of interesting here, type 5, poor communication. 00:08:34So the radiologist identifies a finding is abnormal, but that finding or that information is poorly communicated to the relevant permission, such as the physical therapist, and so that abnormal finding is not appreciated by the therapist. 00:08:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:55So Brook proposed the following classification as an alternative to the Renfrew classification, and this takes more than just human error into account. 00:09:06So the Brook classification starts with latent errors. 00:09:10We have an in-built system or technical faults that predispose to errors in interpretation of images. 00:09:17And then we have active failures or human error, such as diagnostic errors and misinterpretation,  images. 00:09:17And then we have active failures or human error, such as diagnostic errors and misinterpretation, or complications from procedures, and they can involve more than one person or be secondary to latent errors. 00:09:32Then we have external causes which are beyond the control of the radiologist, such as a power failure. 00:09:37And then customer causes which are related to the patient and non-radiology staff. 00:09:42So complying with instructions or unfamiliarity with the procedure, resulting in poor imaging outcomes. 00:09:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:55Another classification system is the Brook classification. 00:10:01And this is an alternative to the Renfrew classification, and it takes more than just human error into account. 00:10:08And so, for example, we have the latent errors, which are in-built system and technical faults that predispose to errors. , for example, we have the latent errors, which are in-built system and technical faults that predispose to errors. 00:10:16Then we have active failures or human error, such as diagnostic errors and misinterpretation, or complications from procedures, usually injections. 00:10:27And then they can involve more than one person or be secondary to latent or built-in errors. 00:10:32And then we have external causes that are beyond the control of the radiologist, such as a power failure. 00:10:37And finally, customer causes or patient causes. 00:10:43It's related to non-radiology staff or patients, and they can include things like not complying with instructions or simply being unfamiliar with the procedure. 00:10:52And so that wraps up this lecture, and, 00:10:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:01I'd remind you to go back and take a look at 57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:01I'd remind you to go back and take a look at those 4 Ds, and also, have a pretty basic idea of what's included in a radiology report. 00:11:09[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com :47And the 4 Ds are to detect, describe, diagnose, or differential diagnosis, and make a decision. 00:01:54[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:59So the first D is detect. 00:02:00The first thing a radiologist needs to do, and it's much improved with information in the referral about the patient's history and examination findings, associated signs, etc. 00:02:11So this is the first task of the radiologist. 00:02:14And again, knowledge of associated signs and pathologies is essential for the radiologist to make the report more accurate. 00:02:23And so what the radiologist detects is going to be included in the findings section of the report. 00:02:29[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:35And then the second thing is describe, and so the findings are described clearly and concisely using medical terminology. 00:02:44  the second thing is describe, and so the findings are described clearly and concisely using medical terminology. 00:02:44It's written for the radiologist so that another radiologist can come to the same conclusion based only on the description. 00:02:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:56The third D is diagnosis or differential diagnosis, and that's the heart of the report and the answer to the clinical question that the referring provider is asking the radiologist. 00:03:06So differentials are ordered in the most likely sequence with a maximum of 3 differentials usually. 00:03:13And again, this is the heart of the report and it's really designed to answer the clinical question. 00:03:21[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:24And finally, the fourth D is the decision, what to do next. 00:03:27Is it important to inform others, and if so, how urgently  decision, what to do next. 00:03:27Is it important to inform others, and if so, how urgently and who to inform? 00:03:33And is immediate communication required? 00:03:35Are further tests recommended? 00:03:38Are the instructions no further testing necessary appropriate for this particular case? 00:03:43[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:53So this is an example radiology report. 00:03:56In addition to a tool for healthcare providers, radiology reports can enable patients to learn about their health, right? 00:04:03Patients can obtain copies of their reports through an electronic portal or even a paper copy. 00:04:08The report should be designed to increase the patient's understanding. 00:04:13So at the top we see technique, and that's right here. 00:04:18[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:27And , and that's right here. 00:04:18[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:27And technique provides information about what was imaged and the type of imaging modality that was used and the information about a contrast agent, if one was present, and last one here. 00:04:40[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:43The comparison in this example indicates that no prior imaging is on record to compare the study with [INAUDIBLE] here. 00:04:49[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:52The findings are where you're going to find descriptions of the areas examined by the radiologist, along with descriptions of abnormalities or normal appearance. 00:05:02Findings may be grouped by paragraphs into the ABCs, and so the findings are right here. 00:05:08And in this case, we have mild straightening of the lumbar spine, likely due to muscular sp 05:08And in this case, we have mild straightening of the lumbar spine, likely due to muscular spasm. 00:05:14Otherwise, the alignment is maintained. 00:05:17No evidence of acute or chronic fracture, and conus medullaris and cauda equina nerve roots are unremarkable. 00:05:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:27And, 00:05:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:31Finally, we have the conclusion at the bottom. 00:05:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:36And the conclusion is the area where the findings are summarized. 00:05:39And it's also where the radiologist labels the condition and may make a diagnosis. 00:05:44If there are multiple diagnoses, they're reported in the order of severity, starting with the most serious diagnosis. 00:05:52So in  diagnoses, they're reported in the order of severity, starting with the most serious diagnosis. 00:05:52So in this case, we have multilevel degenerative disk disease as detailed above, for clinical correlation. 00:05:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:09So radiology reports are intended for physician use, but patients may benefit from a more readable and understandable design, or someone to help them interpret the findings. 00:06:19And so I've included this slide here, and this is from a study that demonstrates a more patient-friendly kind of approach to radiology reports. 00:06:28So in this study, patients were much more satisfied when the results were made more understandable and medical terminology was explained. 00:06:37Especially when the patients are able to link the locations on the imaging to the imaging text content and their current complaints. 00:06:47By helping patients better understand the content of their results,  the imaging text content and their current complaints. 00:06:47By helping patients better understand the content of their results, the patients have a greater understanding of their condition and the rationale for interventions, and their satisfaction with the entire outcome is usually much higher. 00:07:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:06And I apologize for some of the missing text up here. 00:07:09But one of the things to notice here is these pieces here that are underlined, for example, hypertrophy here at the L4-L5 in the image. 00:07:20This text here refers to hypertrophy, and the patient can then go over here to hypertrophy and see that hypertrophy means the enlargement of the cells. 00:07:30Over here, down below you see disc protrusion. 00:07:34The patient can come over here and look at disc protrusion, and you can see that usion. 00:07:34The patient can come over here and look at disc protrusion, and you can see that the spine is intact, but bulge when one or more of this are under pressure. 00:07:44[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:51So this slide has a lot of text, but I included it to remind you that errors do occur in diagnostic radiology. 00:07:58And this is the most widely accepted classification system and the Renfrew classification system. 00:08:05And so there are at least 12 types of errors that occur in diagnostic radiology. 00:08:12Some include, for example, number 10 here, type 10, failure to find a subsequent abnormality after the initial abnormality was detected. 00:08:19And we touched on this earlier, this is failure to note the second fracture. 00:08:25And so they find the first fracture and stop looking. 00
