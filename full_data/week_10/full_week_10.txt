10.1 Nine Conditions You Do Not Want to MissEffects00:00:00[MUSIC] 00:00:09Okay, starting with lecture 10, 9 Conditions You Do Not Want to Miss. 00:00:13[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:21Objectives, so by the end of this lecture, you should be able to identify which red flags are not uncommon to encounter in patients with low back pain and describe why. 00:00:31Identify the 9 conditions in the Do Not Want to Miss list of pathologies which are life threatening and may mimic other common disorders. 00:00:39And describe why it's important for patients to complete an intake questionnaire. 00:00:43[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:48Do not want to miss. 00:00:49Keep in mind that these are more common in adults, in the elderly, and in patients presenting to outpatient settings. 00:00  in mind that these are more common in adults, in the elderly, and in patients presenting to outpatient settings. 00:00:56Beware of unremitting pain that's not made better or worse by anything, including changing positions. 00:01:03So the nine conditions highlighted in this chapter from your textbook are more common in adults, especially in older older adults and those adults seen in ambulatory settings. 00:01:13So what this means is that for PTs working with children or working in an inpatient setting, this list of nine conditions would probably include some different conditions. 00:01:23The point is that all practitioners should have a list of conditions to be extra vigilant for, and know those conditions to a greater depth than others. 00:01:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:37Low back pain. 00:01:38So this table is taken from an article on low back pain, and it's an example of the  screening questions is above. 00:03:49Because of the high sensitivity value associated with the initial two questions, and no response to both, especially in an individual without a history of depression in the past year, makes it very unlikely a major depressive episode is present. 00:04:03Because of the low specificity value, a yes response is not diagnostic, but requires that additional patient information to be collected. 00:04:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:21Additional Information for Recognizing Major Depressive Disorder. 00:04:24Major depressive disorder is the most common mental health condition seen in primary care. 00:04:30The presentation may include mood, cognitive, neurovegetative, or somatic symptoms. 00:04:37There are limited harms associated with screening, as long as a positive screen is followed up on. 00:04:42The Patient Health Questionnaire-2 is a recommended questionnaire to use with these patients 00:  on. 00:04:42The Patient Health Questionnaire-2 is a recommended questionnaire to use with these patients 00:04:47[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:53And this is the Patient Health Questionnaire-2. 00:04:55We can see that the questions are located in the top half and the scoring is the bottom half. 00:05:01And based on the score, we can assess the probability of major depressive disorder. 00:05:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:16Condition number two, suicide risk. 00:05:18In 2017, around 500,000 people saw care related to this in emergency departments. 00:05:26Among ages 15 to 24, suicide is the third leading cause of death. 00:05:31Men aged 65 years or older are the group at highest risk for completed suicides. 00:05:37Prevalence of up to 4% of patients in  the group at highest risk for completed suicides. 00:05:37Prevalence of up to 4% of patients in primary care settings. 00:05:42See box 23 in your textbook for important risk factors. 00:05:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:47So in addition, 50 to 67% of individuals committing suicide will have seen a physician within four weeks of the act. 00:05:55The global suicide rate is 12 per 100,000 individuals making suicide the 14th leading cause of global mortality. 00:06:03The suicide rate in the United States is more than 15 per 100,000 individuals, making suicide the tenth leading cause of death. 00:06:10[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:14Suicide risk screening. 00:06:17So an important factor is a sense of hopelessness or a sense of giving up on the patient. 00:06:23Thoughts of death  is a sense of hopelessness or a sense of giving up on the patient. 00:06:23Thoughts of death, 100% sensitivity and 81% specificity. 00:06:28Patients wishing they were dead, 92% sensitivity and 93 specificity. 00:06:34Be aware that most patients will not volunteer this information. 00:06:38Asking patients whether they are or have been thinking of self-harm is critical. 00:06:42If they answer yes, you should initiate the facility protocol if there is one, including referral immediately. 00:06:50Race is also a factor, with approximately 75% of completed suicides involving white men. 00:06:57Estimates are that approximately 90% of those committing suicide have a history of psychiatric illness, with most having major depression. 00:07:05[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:08Another factor associated with suicide is alcohol abuse. 00:07:13If a _AUDIO] 00:07:08Another factor associated with suicide is alcohol abuse. 00:07:13If a patient responds yes to the question of having thoughts of attempting to harm himself or herself, the clinician should initiate the facility's protocol as I noted above. 00:07:23This should include important follow-up questions regarding whether the patient has a plan in place, whether resources related to the patient's plan are readily available, for example, does the patient own a gun, does the patient have a filled medication, prescription, etc. 00:07:38And the PT should also be aware of who they should contact regarding this information. 00:07:44[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:50Additional information regarding suicide risk, questions for assessing suicide risk. 00:07:56Have you been thinking that you would be better off dead or wishing that you were dead? 00:07:59Do you have thoughts of harming yourself? 00  be better off dead or wishing that you were dead? 00:07:59Do you have thoughts of harming yourself? 00:08:01Have you been thinking about suicide? 00:08:04If you've been thinking about suicide, do you have a plan? 00:08:06If so, describe the plan. 00:08:08Have you recently attempted suicide? 00:08:10In the past, have you thought about or attempted suicide? 00:08:14If the responses identify a detailed plan for ending life, a lack of hope that things can get better in the future, or an inability to identify reasons for not dying, for example not wanting to leave loved ones, is considered a psychiatric emergency requiring immediate intervention and referral. 00:08:30[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com10.3 Conditions 3, 4, 500:00:02L  in your video? | cielo24.com10.3 Conditions 3, 4, 500:00:02Lecture 10.3, conditions three, four and five, femoral head and neck fracture, cauda equina syndrome, and cervical myelopathy. 00:00:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:16Objectives, by the end of this lecture, you should be able to identify risk factors for femoral head and neck fractures. 00:00:23You should describe how femoral head and neck fractures may present in the clinic. 00:00:28You should be able to describe two physical examination tests, which may be useful for identifying femoral head and neck fractures. 00:00:36You should define Cauda Equina Syndrome and describe how a patient with this pathology may present clinically. 00:00:43You should be able to identify red flags, specific to Cauda equina syndrome. 00 . 00:00:43You should be able to identify red flags, specific to Cauda equina syndrome. 00:00:47You should be able to define cervical myelopathy and describe how a patient with this pathology may present clinically. 00:00:55You should be able to identify the three components of diagnosing cervical myelopathy and identify four disorders which may present like cervical myelopathy. 00:01:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:07Femoral head and neck fractures. 00:01:10So femoral head and neck fractures lead to increased morbidity, mortality, and Healthcare issues. 00:01:19Risk factors include, osteoporosis and falls, low socioeconomic status cardiovascular disease, Endocrine disorders, certain medications, and a low BMI. 00:01:31Fall prevention and treatment of osteoporosis are paramount. 00:01:35The relevance of femoral head and neck fractures  prevention and treatment of osteoporosis are paramount. 00:01:35The relevance of femoral head and neck fractures, is that once the injury occurs there is significant morbidity, mortality, and health care issues. 00:01:44Referral for diagnostic imaging can prevent a non-displaced fracture from progressing to a displaced fracture, which, if it occurs, then typically requires surgical intervention. 00:01:55It's estimated that approximately 30-60% of community-dwelling older adults fall each year. 00:02:02Approximately 90% of hip fractures in older patients occur from a simple fall from the standing position. 00:02:08Women sustain hip fractures more often due to their higher rates of osteoporosis. 00:02:13The lifetime risk of hip fracture is 17.5% for women and 6% for men. 00:02:20On average, women who sustain a femoral neck fracture are 77 years old and % for men. 00:02:20On average, women who sustain a femoral neck fracture are 77 years old and men are 72 years old. 00:02:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:33Screening for femoral head and neck fractures. 00:02:36So pain and local tenderness may be associated with the femoral head and neck fracture, particularly in the groin, trochanteric and/or buttock regions. 00:02:44There may be at the presence of deformity including a shortened limb, edema, ecchymosis, loss of function and mobility, including weight bearing. 00:02:52And fracture is not always associated with a fall or major trauma. 00:02:57There may or may not be ecchymosis or edema and palpatory tenderness while common is not necessary. 00:03:04The common deformity includes a shortened limb, with the position of comfort  00:01:38So this table is taken from an article on low back pain, and it's an example of the information you should collect from patients presenting to you with complaints of low back pain. 00:01:49These specific items are particularly important because they may suggest that your patient's low back pain may be caused by another medical condition which is mimicking mechanical low back pain. 00:02:02The goal of red flags is to identify patients who have a higher probability of having a serious underlying medical condition and referring these patients to a physician for further examination to rule out serious medical issues that may not be treatable by standard physical therapy treatment. 00:02:19There is some evidence that you will be referred a patient with low back pain who has not been thoroughly screened for red flags. 00:02:26Two studies have demonstrated that primary care physicians asked about one-half to one-third of red flag identifying questions. 00:02:36In one study,  while common is not necessary. 00:03:04The common deformity includes a shortened limb, with the position of comfort being limb external rotation and abduction. 00:03:12If you strongly suspect a fracture, urgent referral is warranted. 00:03:16A non-displaced femoral head or neck fracture can have a more confusing and much less severe presentation. 00:03:23Resulting in a delay in diagnosis, placing the individual at high risk for progression to a displaced fracture. 00:03:29[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:34Additional information for femoral head neck fractures continued. 00:03:37Please look at your textbook box 20.4 and 20.5 for important risk factors, you should be more vigilant in older patients with a history of reduced bone mineral density. 00:03:52You should watch for pain with weight-bearing, and pain that's relieved immediately in non-weight-bearing positions. 00:  should watch for pain with weight-bearing, and pain that's relieved immediately in non-weight-bearing positions. 00:03:58There may be no pain during range of motion testing. 00:04:01The patellar pubic percussion test may be useful. 00:04:04And also, the fulcrum test may be a useful screen. 00:04:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:12So this slide is a picture of the patellar-pubic percussion test. 00:04:17The patient is comfortably positioned supine, and the legs are placed in a symmetric position. 00:04:23The head of the stethoscope is positioned in the midline on the pubic symphysis. 00:04:27The therapist holds the patella in place and percusses sharply on the patella. 00:04:33The involved limb should produce a duller sound versus cusses sharply on the patella. 00:04:33The involved limb should produce a duller sound versus the limb that is not fractured. 00:04:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:46Condition for Cauda equina syndrome. 00:04:48The Cauda equina syndrome is caused by an intra spinal lesion coddled to the CONUS that injures two or more of the 18 nerve roots constituting the cauda acquired within the lumbar spinal canal. 00:05:00It's typically associated with Martin neurologic disability. 00:05:04The clinical presentation is dominated by bilateral leg weakness and multiple root distributions. 00:05:09And may be associated with perennial century symptoms as well as bowel, bladder, sexual dysfunction due to involvement on the S2-4 spinal nerve roots. 00:05:21Potential etiology due to developmental abnormalities such as neural tube defects, infectious,  spinal nerve roots. 00:05:21Potential etiology due to developmental abnormalities such as neural tube defects, infectious, or inflammatory conditions or [UNKNOWN] such as tumors. 00:05:30[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:36Screening of Cauda Equina Syndrome. 00:05:39Risk factors include low back injury, spinal stenosis, spinal fracture, ankylosis spondylitis, tuberculosis, and pott`s disease. 00:05:49Refer to your textbook Box 20.6. 00:05:51[BLANK_AUDIO]. 00:05:54In a patient who you suspect may have Cauda equina syndrome, you should note gait ataxia or balance deficits or complaints of heavy legs. 00:06:03Bowel, bladder, or sexual dysfunction should be noted. 00:06:06Urinary retention may be the most frequent symptom. 00:06  or sexual dysfunction should be noted. 00:06:06Urinary retention may be the most frequent symptom. 00:06:09The onset of Cauda equina syndrome could be sudden and alarming for patients. 00:06:15Many conditions increase the risk of Cauda Equina Syndrome. 00:06:18Tuberculosis can produce a myelopathy by different mechanisms. 00:06:22Infection of the vertebral body leads to tuberculosis spondylitis or Pott's disease, which can lead to secondary cord compression. 00:06:29These patients present with back pain over the affected vertebrae. 00:06:33A low grade fever and weight loss followed by a secondary compressive myelopathy. 00:06:37[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:51So within this cluster of red flags, the red flags that have an asterisk next to them are specific to Cauda Equina Syndrome.  of red flags, the red flags that have an asterisk next to them are specific to Cauda Equina Syndrome. 00:07:00And so those include difficulty with micturition, loss of anal sphincter tone or fecal incontinence, saddle anesthesia, and gait disturbance. 00:07:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:20Condition number five, Cervical Myelopathy. 00:07:23This is a mechanical compression of neural elements within the central cervical canal. 00:07:29The primary symptoms tend to be neurologic versus pain. 00:07:33Symptoms usually progress over time, but they can be stable for periods. 00:07:36Myelopathy occurs in 5% to 10% of patients with cervical spondylosis. 00:07:41[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:44Generally, degenerative changes in the cervical spine can lead to 41[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:44Generally, degenerative changes in the cervical spine can lead to narrowing of the cervical canal. 00:07:49Which can produce dysfunction of the spinal cord due to compression. 00:07:53The process can damaged nerve roots as well as the cord itself, injury to the anterior horn cells can actually cause lower motor neuron deficits. 00:08:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:09Screening for cervical myelopathy. 00:08:12Risk factors include, age 50s to 60s, of previous diagnosis of cervical spondylosis. 00:08:19Also, look at your text in box 20.7. 00:08:23With these patients, note hand impairment, gait impairment, or balance disturbances. 00:08:28Also, look for subtle signs of neurologic compromise, numbness, or paresthesia, as well as neck stiffness Also, look for subtle signs of neurologic compromise, numbness, or paresthesia, as well as neck stiffness or urinary dysfunction. 00:08:37The diagnosis is really made based on a correlation between the history, the physical exam, and the imaging studies. 00:08:44There is no well-defined pattern of neurologic deficits. 00:08:48It could include pain in the neck subscapular region, arms, numbness or paresthesias in the arms. 00:08:54Possible loss of fine motor control, gait disturbance, sensory deficits such as loss of pain sensation, upper motor neuron signs, lower extremity weakness, hyperreflexia, babinski Sign. 00:09:07Lower motor neuron signs, such as possible suppress reflexes, weakness atrophy, bladder dysfunction. 00:09:16Symptoms usually begin insidiously. 00:09:19Gait impairment is a common early symptom. 00 :16Symptoms usually begin insidiously. 00:09:19Gait impairment is a common early symptom. 00:09:22This is often ill described by the patient who may complain of blade weakness or stiffness, or even complain of a vague unsteadiness. 00:09:29[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:30Patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy may present with progressive bilateral sensory loss and motor dysfunction in the hands without other neurologic symptoms. 00:09:40[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:41Some patients with myelopathy will present acutely, often after minor neck trauma such as from a fall. 00:09:49With a central cord syndrome, characterized by disproportionately greater motor impairment. 00:09:54And upper compared with the lower extremities, bladder dysfunction and a variable degree of sensory loss below the level of the injury. 00:10:01[BLANK_AUDIO  and a variable degree of sensory loss below the level of the injury. 00:10:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:06What you're seeing here in this image, on the right side of the screen here is that chord compression responsible for the myelopathy. 00:10:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:24Differentials, or differential diagnoses from cervical myelopathy include ALS amyotropic lateral sclerosis. 00:10:32Cervical myelopathy lower motor neuron deficits are isolated to cervical myotomes, and then also other cervical disorders. 00:10:40Other pathologies can produce similar symptoms. 00:10:42Guillain-Barre syndrome. 00:10:46Patients with myelopathy usually have hyperreflexia and do not have cranial nerve involvement. 00:10:52Normal pressure hydrocephalus, cervical myelopathy is generally not associated with cognitive dysfunction ALS and  physicians asked about one-half to one-third of red flag identifying questions. 00:02:36In one study, only 27% of the red flag history questions were asked to patients who presented with low back pain. 00:02:43[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:50It's also important to keep in mind, though, that some findings that we call red flags are common. 00:02:57So some red flags are not an uncommon thing to stumble across. 00:03:02For example, of the 159 patient charts asking patients with low back pain whether they suffer from night or constant pain in this study, 71 of them noted a positive response. 00:03:15This doesn't mean that 71 of those 159 patients were immediately referred to their primary care provider. 00:03:22Instead, this finding is noted as important and is weighted along with the rest of the findings from the examination. 00:03:30So the specificity . 00:10:52Normal pressure hydrocephalus, cervical myelopathy is generally not associated with cognitive dysfunction ALS and cervical myelopathy both person present in older adults. 00:11:04A neurological exam demonstrates both upper and lower motor neuron deficits. 00:11:09With cervical myelopathy, lower motor neuron deficits and FAS stipulations are isolated to the affected cervical myotomes. 00:11:16But in ALS, they often appear in the legs and cranial muscles. 00:11:20Guillain-Barré and myelopathy can both present as a subacute progressive paraparesis or quadriparesis. 00:11:28Patients with Guillain-Barré typically have reduced or absent reflexes and may have cranial nerve involvement. 00:11:35While patients with myelopathy usually have hyperreflexia and do not have cranial nerve involvement. 00:11:41[BL  myelopathy usually have hyperreflexia and do not have cranial nerve involvement. 00:11:41[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:49So we see here, looking at cervical myelopathy up here, that age is usually over 60. 00:11:54It's usually progressive or stepwise course. 00:11:59Moderate severe cases demonstrate gait and leg spasticity or amyotrophy of the hand or arms. 00:12:05I mean diagnosis, the gold standard is generally MRI of the cervical spine. 00:12:10And then down here we look at ALS, again usually over 60 years progressive and this is pure motor syndrome, and the diagnosis is made via electromyography 00:12:23[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com10.4 Conditions 6 and 700:00:01This is

aortic aneurysm and deep vein thrombosis. 00:00:13[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:18After this lecture you should be able to define abdominal aortic aneurysm and describe risk factors associated with it. 00:00:25You should be able to describe how a patient suffering from an abdominal aortic aneurysm may present clinically. 00:00:32You should be able to describe how to screen a patient you suspect is suffering from abdominal aortic aneurysm, including palpation. 00:00:40You should be able to define deep vein thrombosis and describe risk factors associated with DV . 00:00:40You should be able to define deep vein thrombosis and describe risk factors associated with DVT. 00:00:45And define wells and modified wells score and how to screen a patient you suspect may have a DVT. 00:00:51[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:58Abdominal aortic aneurysm. 00:01:00An aneurysm is a bulge or ballooning, and in the case of abdominal aortic aneurysm, it's a bulge or ballooning of the abdominal aortic artery. 00:01:10Surgery carries a 4.2% risk of mortality and a 32% complication rate. 00:01:15The abdominal aortic aneurysm, or AAA, usually occurs in individuals age 60 and older. 00:01:22The typical complaint is back pain. 00:01:24[BLANK_  60 and older. 00:01:22The typical complaint is back pain. 00:01:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:30An abdominal aortic aneurysm is an abnormal focal dilation of the abdominal aorta. 00:01:35It's often asymptomatic, but it's discovered by palpating a pulsatile mass during physical examination. 00:01:42Imaging confirmation is required for making the diagnosis. 00:01:47In this image on the right, the patient was referred to CT to scan to exclude an aortic dissection. 00:01:55Little did the patient know, contained rupture of a previously unknown abdominal aortic aneurysm was diagnosed. 00:02:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:06Surgery was performed and the patient walked home two weeks later. 00:02:11Ruptured aneurysms present with severe  performed and the patient walked home two weeks later. 00:02:11Ruptured aneurysms present with severe abdominal or back pain and hypotension or shock. 00:02:16The mortality rate from a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is high, 59% to 83% of patients die before they make it to the hospital or undergo surgery. 00:02:26As noted above, the operative mortality rate for those who do make it to surgery is also high. 00:02:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:38All right, so this is a pain location drawing from a real case, and I want you to note the location and description of the patient's symptoms. 00:02:47So the patient described these symptoms here as constant, and they're varying from bloated feeling with intermittent sharp and stabbing sensations. 00:02:57In their low back they describe a constant varying, deep, dull ache with  and stabbing sensations. 00:02:57In their low back they describe a constant varying, deep, dull ache with intermittent throbbing sensations. 00:03:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:05.And this was at the patient's initial physical therapy visit before they were diagnosed with the abdominal aortic aneurysm. 00:03:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:18Characteristics of abdominal aortic aneurysms. 00:03:21Most individuals with abdominal aortic aneurysm have no symptoms. 00:03:27Risk factors are age, male sex, cigarette smoking, and hypertension. 00:03:32Also, trauma, syphilis, Marfan's-Ehlers-Danlos, and other connective tissue disorders, as well as a history of an aneurysm. 00:03:40See Box 20.8 in your textbook. 00:  a history of an aneurysm. 00:03:40See Box 20.8 in your textbook. 00:03:43[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:46When palpating the abdomen, a prominent lateral pulsation can give you a clue that there may be an underlying abdominal aortic aneurysm. 00:03:56To perform this palpation, the patient lies supine and the examiner places the fingertips over the epigastrium to determine if a pulse is present. 00:04:04Both hands are placed on either side of the aorta to help determine the aortic width. 00:04:09A positive test is that the abdominal aorta is greater than three centimeters in width. 00:04:17So age and male gender are important risk factors because the prevalence of AAA is five to six times greater in men than women. 00:04:25A history of smoking carries at three to five  is five to six times greater in men than women. 00:04:25A history of smoking carries at three to five times greater risk for developing a AAA. 00:04:30The effect of smoking plus age consideration was demonstrated by a study inviting men aged 65 to 74 years of age, with a lifetime consumption of smoking more than 100 cigarettes into AAA screening. 00:04:43It was estimated that eliminating the smoking would result in 89% reduction in abdominal aortic aneurysm related deaths in this age group. 00:04:53[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:59So palpation for abdominal aortic aneurysm has a sensitivity of 68 and a specificity of 75 likelihood ratio of 2.7. 00:05:09And accuracy is improved by smaller patient waist size and larger aneurysm size. 00:05:15The ability to palpate will depend on the patient's body morphology. 00:05:19 . 00:05:15The ability to palpate will depend on the patient's body morphology. 00:05:19Detecting a AAA with palpation, again, is a 68 percent sensitivity. 00:05:24A waist size less than 100 centimetres and larger aneurysms, meaning aneurysms greater than 5 centimetres, increase the sensitivity. 00:05:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:34So once a pulse has been detected with mid abdominal palpation, the PT places fingertips with deep and gentle pressure along the sides of the pulse, noting the presence of a laterally expansive pulsation. 00:05:47Such a finding what further worn abdominal auscultation are brewing keep in mind the sensitivity on this is not great and very dependent on body morphology. 00:05:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:05Deep vein thrombosis. 00:06:07Consider  noted as important and is weighted along with the rest of the findings from the examination. 00:03:30So the specificity of quote, aged 50 and over unquote, or trauma or night constant pain in this sample of patients is not high for identifying serious underlying pathology in patients with low back pain, but it should not be ignored. 00:03:47The regular and consistent use of a thorough patient intake questionnaire form will be extremely helpful for comprehensively documenting meaningful findings including red flags. 00:03:58[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:04So the Do Not Want To Miss List of nine conditions is in your textbook. 00:04:09These are nine disorders, 00:04:11[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:04:14And they carry a high mortality risk and a high morbidity risk. 00:04:19These conditions can also be difficult to differentiate from other conditions, and therefore difficult to diagnose. 00:04: [BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:05Deep vein thrombosis. 00:06:07Consider a vascular origin for any leg pain that is not musculoskeletal in nature. 00:06:13A patient with arterial insufficiency may describe pain that increases with exercise and decreases with rest. 00:06:20A patient who may be suffering from venous insufficiently may describe pain as gradual and onset. 00:06:26It may be delayed, and may have greater variability. 00:06:29It could be constant from hours to days. 00:06:32It also may be life-threatening in the form of thrombophlebitis, or pulmonary embolism. 00:06:3850% of DVTs are asymptomatic in the early stages. 00:06:43Pain or weakness that occurs in the calves and sometimes the thighs or the buttocks with exercise and then dissipates at rest :43Pain or weakness that occurs in the calves and sometimes the thighs or the buttocks with exercise and then dissipates at rest is most likely related to peripheral vascular disease. 00:06:56Intermittent claudication is pain that comes on rapidly during exercise and then is relieved by rest. 00:07:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:05In your textbook, please see box 20.9 for DVT risk factors. 00:07:10And we can see on the table on the right here that there are a number of causes for the development of venous thrombosis. 00:07:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:22Regarding the history, it's very important to ask if there's a history of previous blood clots in the lower extremities. 00:07:29Ask about other blood clotting disorders, recent trauma to the legs, history of abdominal cancers, prolonged immobility or 29Ask about other blood clotting disorders, recent trauma to the legs, history of abdominal cancers, prolonged immobility or travel, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, chronic spinal conditions, paraesthesia. 00:07:43Lower extremity weakness or calf pain, especially during walking or exercise. 00:07:49Physical examination should include examination of temperature, color, condition of the skin, the presence of arterial pulses and the lower extremities, calf redness or edema. 00:08:01Sensation testing reflexes and note any discomfort with ambulation. 00:08:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:11So again for the physical examination, and a patient you suspect may be suffering from a DVT. 00:08:17Assess the temperature, color and condition of the skin, assess the presence of pulses in the lower extremities. 00:08:24Look for calf redness or edema. 00:08  of pulses in the lower extremities. 00:08:24Look for calf redness or edema. 00:08:26Test sensation and reflexes and note any discomfort with ambulation. 00:08:31[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:39The Wells' criteria for DVT You should only apply the Wells criteria after the history and physical examination is suggestive of a DVT. 00:08:48Recognize the importance of pretest probability, unilateral leg pain, redness, swelling, edema, warmth, tenderness. 00:08:57Age over 55 and history of bed rest or immobility all increase the probability. 00:09:03In terms of physical findings, a difference in calf circumference, dilated superficial veins, unilateral warmth, tenderness, erythema, pain and tenderness along the course of involved major veins and local mass. 00:09:18Or signs of malignancy are also suggestive  along the course of involved major veins and local mass. 00:09:18Or signs of malignancy are also suggestive of DVT. 00:09:23From Dr. Wells regarding his scores, the model should be applied only after a history and physical suggests that DVT is a diagnostic possibility. 00:09:32It should not be applied to all patients with chest pain or dyspnea or all patients with leg pain or swelling. 00:09:39This is the most common mistake that's made with the Wells criteria. 00:09:43A larger calf circumference is the most usual finding. 00:09:46One meta-analysis reported that patients with a difference in calf circumference were twice as likely to have a DVT. 00:09:54Holman's sign, calf pain on passive dorsiflexion of the foot, is unreliable for the presence of DVT. 00:10:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:  is unreliable for the presence of DVT. 00:10:01[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:06So this is the Wells score. 00:10:09And we can see clinical features are each given a score of one at their present. 00:10:13So active cancer, paralysis, creases or recent plaster immobilization of the lower extremities. 00:10:19Recently bedridden for more than three days or major surgery within four weeks, localized tenderness along the distribution of the deep venous system, entire swelling of a leg. 00:10:29Calf swelling by more than three centimeters when compared to the asymptomatic leg. 00:10:36Pitting, edema, collateral, superficial veins, and an alternative diagnosis as likely or more likely than that of DVT would result in subtracting two points. 00:10:46And then this results in suspicion of high probability, moderate probability, or low probability ing two points. 00:10:46And then this results in suspicion of high probability, moderate probability, or low probability. 00:10:54There's also a modification here. 00:10:56And that modification includes taking into account a previously documented DBT. 00:11:04So patients may be assigned to one of three risk categories, high, moderate, and low, but it's also acceptable to use two categories, unlikely or likely. 00:11:14[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com 04:19These conditions can also be difficult to differentiate from other conditions, and therefore difficult to diagnose.

20.2 for important risk factors. 00:01:00A 2-question initial screening is recommended, so box 20.2 in your text provides a list of risk factors related to major depressive disorder. 00:01:10In a 2017 study, only 18% physical therapists in this study screened their patients for depressive disorder. 00:01:18[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:24Major Dep  their patients for depressive disorder. 00:01:18[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:24Major Depressive Disorder Screening. 00:01:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:30To meet the criteria for major depressive episodes, an individual must have symptoms over a two-week period that represent a change from previous functioning, with at least one of the symptoms being a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. 00:01:43The mnemonic SIGECAPS is helpful for remembering criteria for depression. 00:01:47[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:51A depressed mood most of the day nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report or an observation made by others, is criteria number one. 00:02:01Markedly diminished interest or pleasure and all or almost all activities most of the day nearly every day is criteria two. 00:02:08Criteria three is significant weight loss when  activities most of the day nearly every day is criteria two. 00:02:08Criteria three is significant weight loss when not dieting, weight gain, or a decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. 00:02:17In children consider failure to make expected weight gains. 00:02:20That's criteria three. 00:02:21Criteria four is insomnia, or hypersomnia nearly every day. 00:02:26So inability to sleep, or sleeping excessively. 00:02:30Number five is psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day. 00:02:34Observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down. 00:02:40Number six is fatigue, or loss of energy nearly every day. 00:02:44Number seven, feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day. 00:02:52Number eight is diminished ability to think or concentrate or indecisiveness nearly  inappropriate guilt nearly every day. 00:02:52Number eight is diminished ability to think or concentrate or indecisiveness nearly every day. 00:02:58And number nine is recurrent thoughts of death, not just fear of dying, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan for a suicidal attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. 00:03:10[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:15A two question initial screening is recommended with a positive response leading to additional screening. 00:03:22This screening tool asks the following questions. 00:03:25Over the past two weeks have you felt down, depressed or hopeless and or little interest or pleasure in doing things? 00:03:35A positive response carries a sensitivity of 96 and a specificity of 57. 00:03:43A flowchart for PTS showing the sequence of screening questions is above. 00:03:49Because of the high sensitivity value associated with the initial two questions,
