7.1 What is CT?Effects00:00:00[MUSIC] 00:00:11So lecture 7, Computed Tomography, what is CT? 00:00:15[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:23So, our objectives for this lecture are to be able to explain in lay terms what CT is and then describe how CT images are created. 00:00:33And as an aside, my goal with introducing you to these different imaging modalities, is to try and give you enough information without overwhelming you with all of the tiny details. 00:00:45[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:49So, this is a CT machine that you might see in a typical imaging center or a hospital and this platform, here at the patient would lie on. 00:01:00And then the platform would move the patient into the tube. 00:01:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:  then the platform would move the patient into the tube. 00:01:06[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:10So what is CT, well, CT is a medical imaging technique which uses x-rays to build detailed cross-sectional images of the body. 00:01:21The picture we're looking at here is a case of polyarticular gout. 00:01:26So this patient presented with generalized edema of the foot and ankle and there's well defined erosion of the first proximal phalangeal head medially, and we can see the green areas are crystal deposition. 00:01:42Which is actually monosodium urate crystals and these are the agent responsible for this acute inflammatory condition that we call gout. 00:01:52So we can see gout here on the first toe, but we can also see it on the third and the second up here, and it's even present at the midfoot and  but we can also see it on the third and the second up here, and it's even present at the midfoot and the sinus tarsi. 00:02:06And if the image were rotated, we'd actually see it on the lateral aspect of the foot and ankle involving the lateral ankle ligament complex in this patient, like we see here. 00:02:18[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:20Okay, something like this. 00:02:22[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:24So, how does CT work? 00:02:27[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:28Well, with CT, we have an x-ray emitter over here that actually rotates around a patient, and we also have a detector here with the letter D, and the green arrow. 00:02:42And that's placed on the opposite side, and that detector picks up the image of  green arrow. 00:02:42And that's placed on the opposite side, and that detector picks up the image of a body section, and the beam and the detector move in synchrony, and they rotate, 00:02:55[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:57Around, and so unlike an x-ray, the detector of the CT doesn't actually produce an image. 00:03:04Instead, it measures the transmission of x-rays through a full CT of the body and then the image of that section is taken from different angles. 00:03:13And that allows us to retrieve that third dimension, as opposed to x-rays where we only have two dimensions. 00:03:20So, to get those 3D images of a patient, the computer uses a bunch of mathematical algorithms and reconstructs the image using that data from the CT and that's. 00:03:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:  image using that data from the CT and that's. 00:03:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:38Sir Godfrey Hounsfield, is the gentleman who's credited with coming up with the idea for a CT scanner, and this is his sketch of the idea for the CT. 00:03:50[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:55So this is Mr Hounsfield in 1972 and the first CT image of the human brain was made about 50 years ago on October 1st 1971. 00:04:06And we should notice here is the size of the scanner because it was dedicated to only scanning the head. 00:04:14So, CT revolutionized the ability to visualize soft tissues and the guy who revolutionized it was an engineer and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1979. 00:04:27And the idea for the CT came from a discussion Hounsfield had with a physician, who  00:04:27And the idea for the CT came from a discussion Hounsfield had with a physician, who noted that while the x-rays were great at imaging bones, they were not so great at being able to look at soft tissues such as the brain very well. 00:04:43So Mr. Hounsfield decided that you could look at slices of the brain using x-rays, beamed at different angles. 00:04:52And, Hounsfield divided into consecutive slices the brain like a sliced loaf of bread, and the x-rays would be beamed through each slice of bread, once for each degree in a half circle. 00:05:05So, 180 degrees or 180 beam slices, so, again, you imagine we have our emitter over here. 00:05:11Receptors here and slowly collecting images at different angles, and so the strength of the beam would be caught on the opposite side by the  here and slowly collecting images at different angles, and so the strength of the beam would be caught on the opposite side by the detector and more intense signals would result from stronger beams. 00:05:34And the stronger beams would indicate that the beam signals had traveled through tissue that was less dense, while weaker signals being caught by the receptor would indicate that the beam had traveled through tissue that was more dense. 00:05:49So, Hounsfield created an algorithm to reconstruct the image based on these layers from all of these different angles. 00:05:57And, by working backward and using one of the fastest new computers back in the 70s, Hounsfield could calculate the value for each little box of each brain layer. 00:06:11And so what we're looking here at are the different angles that the beams are passing through, giving us a little bit of data for each angle. 00:06:24So the team installed a full-size , giving us a little bit of data for each angle. 00:06:24So the team installed a full-size CT scanner at a hospital in London on October 1, 1971. 00:06:31They scanned their first patient who is a middle aged woman with evidence of a brain tumor in the left frontal lobe, sort of like here, this dark area. 00:06:43So the process included about 30 minutes for the scan, and then driving across town with all these magnetic tapes with all the data on it. 00:06:52In two and a half hours to process the data on a big mainframe computer, and then capturing the image with a polaroid camera, and then driving back all the way across town to the hospital. 00:07:06So quite a process, so here's Hounsfield being presented with his Nobel Prize in 1979, and modern scanners are obviously much faster. 00:07:17They provide higher resolution and most important  Nobel Prize in 1979, and modern scanners are obviously much faster. 00:07:17They provide higher resolution and most important, they do it with less radiation exposure. 00:07:22They're even mobile CT scanners now, and there are more than 80 million CT scans taken annually in the United States. 00:07:30[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com 7.2 CT vs Conventional Radiography00:00:01So Lecture 7.2, [UNKNOWN] how is CT different from Conventional Radiography? 00:00:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:11Our objectives for this Lecture 7.2 are to identify how CT scanning data is different from standard radiographs, or x-rays. 00:00:21And describe the advantages and disadvantages of CT. 00:00:25And identify two settings in which CT is the preferred modality. 00:00:31So CT versus x-ray or conventional radiography. 00:00:35They both employ x rays, but the CT reconstructs images from multiple scans along cross-sectional slices while X rays create an image from a single scan. 00:00:45This is what we covered in the prior lecture, while we rotate the emitter and the receptor and collect images from a number of different angles,  covered in the prior lecture, while we rotate the emitter and the receptor and collect images from a number of different angles, and then assemble all that data into a much more complex image. 00:01:01So modern CT scanning, well, it used to be that the x-ray tube moved circumferentially around the patient as we saw in those early slides that I showed you. 00:01:12We had this, 00:01:13[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:18Tube like that and the x-rays looked around like this and you had a table, right? 00:01:30And so the circle would be completed and a number of projections would be collected. 00:01:37And then the table with the patient on it would advance just a little bit. 00:01:42And a new slice would be taken and the emitter would rotate all the way around the patient, taking images from a bunch of different  or radiolucent right here. 00:08:25And then the other thing to note in this picture is the width of the spinal canal is much greater at the atlantoaxial joint right here at A, when we compare it to down here at the level of C7 and B, and that's because there's a retrolisthesis at the C5, 6 and the C6, 7 arrows. 00:08:49Get rid of that so you can see those arrows a little better, okay? 00:08:53So that's right here, see 5, 6 and see 6, 7. 00:08:59[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:09:02So here's an image of L1 with degenerative changes and this is a transverse slice from an axial image. 00:09:10As if the patient were in a supine position with the viewer standing at the feet looking up. 00:09: 10As if the patient were in a supine position with the viewer standing at the feet looking up. 00:09:17And sagittal images are viewed from left to right, while coronal images are viewed as if the patient is facing the viewer, viewing images from front to back. 00:09:27So, again, this is an axial slice of the L1 vertebra of an older woman with significant degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. 00:09:36So, number 1 here is the liver and the 12th rib is on the right here in number 2, and the diaphragm here, let's see that, in number 3. 00:09:55And then an osteophyte off the right side of the vertebral body it's present right here in 4. 00:10:05And finally, the abdominal aorta we can see in the dashed outline over there. 00:10:10And the left kidney , the abdominal aorta we can see in the dashed outline over there. 00:10:10And the left kidney in 5, right here. 00:10:15And then finally, the spinous process here in 6. 00:10:19[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:23So the key thing to keep in mind here is that you're viewing this image as if the patient is supine with you standing at the feet looking towards the patient's head. 00:10:37[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:43For evaluating bone CT produces tremendous results, and what we're looking at here in this image on the right is narrowing of the spinal canal and intervertebral foramina at the L5-S1 joint of a patient who's complaining of right leg pain. 00:11:02And number 1, we're looking at these sacroiliac joint right here, right, so the joint between these 02And number 1, we're looking at these sacroiliac joint right here, right, so the joint between these two surfaces. 00:11:10Number 2 is the sacral ala, and then number 3 is hypertrophy and superior articular processes of S1, here. 00:11:20[INAUDIBLE] And those are causing narrowing of the intervertebral foramina. 00:11:27And number 4 is the vertebral body of S1 with large osteophytes on the lateral and posterior margins of the arrows. 00:11:36So if we look at the contour here, you can see how it puffs out there a little bit, and puffs out there a little bit, and also puffs out here. 00:11:48So the dotted line shows the normal outlines of the spinal canal. 00:11:54This area should normally just be space and we can see how this vertebral body has  spinal canal. 00:11:54This area should normally just be space and we can see how this vertebral body has encroached on that space. 00:12:06This is an image of degenerative changes at the medial knee and it's a sagittal plane CT scan through the medial compartment of a knee that has significant degenerative changes and multiple loose bodies. 00:12:21And the loose bodies are in the posterior knee joint space. 00:12:26And we can see that they're bright or radio dense. 00:12:29And there's also a baker's cyst posterior to the joint here. 00:12:35[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:37And that baker cyst also contains multiple loose bodies. 00:12:42[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:44And in this CT image we're viewing a comminuted fracture of the left scapula. 00:12:49And  in this CT image we're viewing a comminuted fracture of the left scapula. 00:12:49And so we see posterior and anterior views of a comminuted fracture of the left scapula from a patient who is a bicyclist who fell during a race. 00:12:59And suffered a direct impact on the scapula. 00:13:03This fracture was actually treated conservatively. 00:13:08So what are the limitations of CT? 00:13:12Well, different tissues, for example, a tumor and the surrounding muscle may be assigned the same shades of gray, so they may look similar if their radio densities are similar. 00:13:23There's also a relatively high radiation exposure from CT versus traditional radiography. 00:13:29So the tissue type or the histological makeup is difficult to determine from CT because tissues with similar radio densities will have similar shades of gray. 00:13:39  is difficult to determine from CT because tissues with similar radio densities will have similar shades of gray. 00:13:39Even if one of the tissues is a tumor and the other one is a muscle. 00:13:43And another meaningful concern with CT, as I mentioned, is the relatively high radiation exposure associated with it versus other kinds of imaging modalities such as radiography like X-ray, or MRI or ultrasound 00:13:59[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com  new slice would be taken and the emitter would rotate all the way around the patient, taking images from a bunch of different angles, and then the table would advance again and the process would repeat. 00:01:56And so you have this delay between each slice. 00:02:00Now there are what are called spiral scanners and they don't have that stop and go action. 00:02:07And instead they move continuously during the examination process. 00:02:11And this results in a slice that is an axial, but is helical, right? 00:02:16So, instead of going around in a circle, you have a slice that goes around like that. 00:02:27And so data is collected by a number of detector rows simultaneously and those multiple detector row scanners or what are called multislice CT or MSCT scanners. 00:02:42They really represent a major advance in the ability to acquire large volumes of data with  MSCT scanners. 00:02:42They really represent a major advance in the ability to acquire large volumes of data with high accuracy and much shorter imaging times. 00:02:52And so this is an example of a CT arthrography of the knee and orthogonal planes are employed in both CT and MRI. 00:03:01And the imaging example here is from a CT arthrography study of the knee as I mentioned, and can see a coronal, sagittal and axial plane. 00:03:12So as opposed to the last slide with the orthogonal planes produced by a CT, this is also a CT of the lateral left ankle. 00:03:22And it's a three-dimensional reformatted CT image. 00:03:27And in it, we can see the tibia, and fibula, and the peroneus longus, and brevis. 00:03:34And here we , and fibula, and the peroneus longus, and brevis. 00:03:34And here we can see the Achilles tendon and the calcaneus. 00:03:39And with these kinds of images, you can see much more clearly how tendons might move over areas of a healed fracture, or you might be able to see subtle joint degenerative changes. 00:03:54You could just see much more in detail than you can in some of the other kinds of radiography. 00:04:01So some of the different forms of CT imaging include three-dimensional CT like we saw on the last slide or on the first slide with the gout. 00:04:09Then there's a CT Myelogram and a Cone Beam CT. 00:04:14So as the name applies, the three-dimensional CT is created by what's called volumetric scanning. 00:04:20So you put together slices and pieces dimensional CT is created by what's called volumetric scanning. 00:04:20So you put together slices and pieces of slices, allowing body parts to be rotated on a computer screen. 00:04:27A CT myelogram, and this is used less often over time because it requires injection of contrast material into the subarachnoid space. 00:04:36It's useful in limited cases such as operative spinal stenosis. 00:04:42Cone Beam CT instead of the patient moving continuously through the unit a cone beam CT gathers all the data in one sweep of the scanner using a large cone shaped X ray beam. 00:04:56And images instead of slices then are based on one large volume of data, and scanning time is shorter with less radiation exposure. 00:05:05And this is used most frequently in the hand and wrist, and also in dentistry. 00:05:10So this is a CT myelogram of  the hand and wrist, and also in dentistry. 00:05:10So this is a CT myelogram of L4-L5, and this is taken from your McKinney's book. 00:05:16The L4 nerve exits above the level displayed in the image, but here in the image you can see. 00:05:22The L5 nerve root, this sort of gray area here, a little more diffuse. 00:05:28And one of the things I'd like you to take away is that because it's a myelogram, we know that there's a substance that's been injected into here. 00:05:38And the structures we can see here are the multifidus, and the ligamentum flavum here. 00:05:45The capsule the preset joint here, the thecall sac with the cauda equina here. 00:05:53We can see the inferior articular process here of L  sac with the cauda equina here. 00:05:53We can see the inferior articular process here of L 4, and facet joint and a superior process at L 5 right there. 00:06:02[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:04Essentially though, you would get much more detail in this area with the myelogram than you would with a traditional x-ray. 00:06:14So viewing CT images, recall PACS, Picture Archiving and Communication Systems. 00:06:21And these digital storage systems allow the image to be stored and transferred to different locations, and the image quality is maintained. 00:06:32And so I think the thing to really keep in mind here is that this digital sort of system is much different than, as we mentioned in one of the earlier lectures. 00:06:41Transferring physical copies of images, X-ray images etc., between locations much more efficient, much higher :06:41Transferring physical copies of images, X-ray images etc., between locations much more efficient, much higher quality information. 00:06:54So viewing CT images, the image radio densities are similar to conventional radiographs. 00:07:01And shades of gray are going to reflect the radio density of the tissue. 00:07:06Denser structures in CT are going to appear white or brighter, and less dense structures are going to appear dark. 00:07:14So, as opposed to CT, in an MRI, the dense structures appear dark or black, all right? 00:07:22So CT, dense structures appear white or bright. 00:07:25MRI, the dense structures are going to appear dark or black. 00:07:30And so, if we look at the image here on the right, this is a mid-sagittal CT image of the cervical spine from your McKinnis book. 00:  right, this is a mid-sagittal CT image of the cervical spine from your McKinnis book. 00:07:41It's an 80-year-old man with significant spinal stenosis. 00:07:45And, if we look at the cortical bone of the posterior occiput, right, the posterior part of the skull right here, we can see it appears very bright or white. 00:07:56And if we compare that to the CT vertebrae right here, this is gray because of the cancellous bone versus the cortical bone of number one. 00:08:06And then the trapezius muscle 3, it's a little darker, but it's not quite as dark as the subcutaneous fat at number 4. 00:08:17And then the air in the pharynx is black, or radiolucent right here. 00:08:25And then the other thing to note in this picture is the 7.3 Neuroimaging00:00:01So this is lecture 7.3 computer tomography and some MR neural imaging. 00:00:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:11And the objectives for this lecture are to define structural neural imaging. 00:00:17Define functional neural imaging. 00:00:19Describe ideal use cases for CT neural imaging, and describe ideal use cases for MR neural imaging. 00:00:28So structural imaging is examining the anatomy of the brain to diagnose pathology. 00:00:37The physical structure and functional imaging is monitoring activity in the brain based on metabolic activity. 00:00:44So this is used in research and to diagnose pathology that's too small to be detected via physical or structural changes. 00:00:54When discussing CT neuroimaging and MR neuroimaging, CT versus MRI, in an acute setting, CT is the modality of choice because of the short scan  neuroimaging, CT versus MRI, in an acute setting, CT is the modality of choice because of the short scan time. 00:01:07MRI typically takes longer to complete a scan. 00:01:11A head CT is the standard protocol in trauma for immediate assessment of intracranial bleeding. 00:01:17MRI also plays a large role in detecting changes in fluid content, or ischemia, or edema, and hemorrhage. 00:01:25And it does this more accurately than a CT, again, at the expense of time. 00:01:31So this is an image comparing CT and MRI, and you can see figure 4-15 in your McKinnis text. 00:01:39And this axial slice is referred to as the cross. 00:01:44And note on the MRI how the gray matter produced a lower signal intensity. 00:01:50It's darker than the white matter, and  MRI how the gray matter produced a lower signal intensity. 00:01:50It's darker than the white matter, and the subcutaneous fat is white. 00:01:58So regarding the CT exam in your McKinnis texts, please go through the six brain images from the six axial slices. 00:02:06And they reveal the Cross, the Star, Mr. Happy, Mr. Sad, the Worms, and the Coffee Bean. 00:02:15And this is an image of a CT without contrast showing a thrombosis in the right middle cerebral artery. 00:02:22You can see it, right? 00:02:26And this is an MRI 12 hours later, which demonstrates increased signal intensity, that brighter image with the dotted lines in front. 00:02:36[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com IO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com 7.4 fMRI, PET, and EEGEffects00:00:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:02This is lecture 74 we're going to continue with computer tomography and STEM magnetic resonance imaging functional MRI and EEG 00:00:13[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:16So our objective here is to by the end of the lecture, we should be able to explain the differences between functional fMRI, PET and EEG. 00:00:26Including examples of use-cases, advantages and disadvantages. 00:00:32MRI neuroimaging and it's used for a visualization of brain soft tissue. 00:00:38One of the benefits is that there's no exposure to radiation with MRI. 00:00:42However, it can't be used or it's difficult to use with individuals who are uncomfortable in enclosed spaces. 00:00:51And it also can't be used in patients who have metallic implants  who are uncomfortable in enclosed spaces. 00:00:51And it also can't be used in patients who have metallic implants. 00:00:56Or who don't tolerate loud environments very well. 00:00:59Functional MRI or fMRI. 00:01:03This is used for localization of brain activity associated with a cognitive task or behavior. 00:01:10However, it has limited resolution and it's really an indirect measure of brain activity. 00:01:16Because the activity is measured via metabolic changes that are occurring. 00:01:22Positron emission tomography, PET. 00:01:25This is useful for localization of brain activity associated with performing a cognitive task or behavior. 00:01:32It's silence and it tracks various metabolites such as glucose. 00:01:38The drawback here is that there's very poor spatial resolution. 00:01:41It requires radioactive tracers, it's very expensive. 00  that there's very poor spatial resolution. 00:01:41It requires radioactive tracers, it's very expensive. 00:01:46It's limited to short tasks, again, due to the radiation exposure. 00:01:50Like the fMRI, it's an indirect measure of brain activity. 00:01:56EEG, electroencephalogram and ERP, evoked and related potentials. 00:02:03So this is a direct recording of electrical brain activity associated with a cognitive task or behavior. 00:02:10It's silent, non-invasive, it's low cost. 00:02:14The brain activity can be directly as opposed to indirectly associated with an event or stimulus. 00:02:19However, very poor spatial resolution versus fMRI and the analysis of the results that you get from an EEG can be very complex. 00:02:31MRI based neural imaging techniques. 00:02:34We'll  an EEG can be very complex. 00:02:31MRI based neural imaging techniques. 00:02:34We'll start with the image on the left, which is a structural MRI. 00:02:38This reveals the gross anatomical structure of the brain with high detail, and in this case, in a sagittal view. 00:02:46Now, just to the right of that, we have a diffusion MRI. 00:02:50This reveals the overall layout of white matter connections and pathways within the brain. 00:02:56This is referred to as tractography because we're going to be looking at tracks the color scheme corresponds to the orientation of the white matter fibers. 00:03:05And so the green tract represents fibers extending between the front and the back of the brain. 00:03:12Red is for fibers that run from the left to the right. 00:03:16And blue is fibers that run along the axis from the top  run from the left to the right. 00:03:16And blue is fibers that run along the axis from the top to the bottom of the brain. 00:03:22And then finally over in C on the far right, we have a functional MRI. 00:03:27And this reveals areas of the brain that are active when an individual is asked to perform a particular task. 00:03:33[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:35In this case, an individual who is congenitally blind was asked to identify a tactile pattern through touch. 00:03:43So no areas of activation identified throughout the brain in yellow, including within the occipital cortex. 00:03:50Which is normally associated with visual information processing and that's identified by the yellow arrow here. 00:03:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:58So in this image we're looking at diffusion MRI again. 00:04: _AUDIO] 00:03:58So in this image we're looking at diffusion MRI again. 00:04:02This is white matter tractography, reconstruction and a normally sighted control subject in A and paired with an age matched individual with cerebral visual cortical visual impairment B. 00:04:16So, in the individual on the left, individual A, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, the superior longitudinal fasciculus, and the inferior fronto occipital fasciculus are all evident. 00:04:31And now contrast that with the individual on the right, individual B. 00:04:36You can see the marked reductions in each of these fasciculus is evident. 00:04:41The color scheme represents the direction, just like we saw on the

MRI00:00:02So, magnetic resonance imaging, what is an MRI image? 00:00:06And we discussed MRI briefly in the last section in relationship to MR neural imaging and so we'll get into a little more detail here in this lecture 00:00:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:19So, the objective here is to describe in general how magnetic resonance images are created. 00:00:26So, this is an image created in 1976, and this is the first MRI scan of a human and it's the cross-section of a research student's finger. 00:00:37What is MRI? 00:00:39MRI is an imaging technology that uses a magnetic field and radio frequency signals to create cross-sectional images, and there's no exposure to ionizing radiation. 00:00:50A key here is that biological tissues contain around 75% water, and that water can be easily detected  00:00:50A key here is that biological tissues contain around 75% water, and that water can be easily detected by magnetic resonance. 00:01:02So as opposed to X-rays, the MRI uses energy emitted from a hydrogen nuclei after they've been stimulated by radio frequency signals. 00:01:11So, radio frequency, those signals cause hydrogen nuclei to emit signals, and those signals are then converted to images by a computer. 00:01:28So, MRI was initially called Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging or NMR or NMRI, because of its early use in chemical analysis. 00:01:38However, the nuclear part was dropped about 25 years ago because of fears that people would think that there was something radioactive involved, which there's not. 00:01:46So, how does MRI work? 00:01:49Well, different body tissues contain different amounts of water and the variation in water content can be used to help differentiate 01:49Well, different body tissues contain different amounts of water and the variation in water content can be used to help differentiate various organs within the body. 00:01:58So, similar to how we discussed X-rays working with the different tissue densities attenuating the beam. 00:02:07The MRI works because different amounts of water result in a variation in the properties of the image. 00:02:14And we can see from this figure here, we look at gray matter, which is we'll say 85% water in this image and bone 17% water. 00:02:25That's going to result in structures with distinctly different image properties. 00:02:34So, the MRI machine. 00:02:36The early MR research really revolved around the idea again that different body tissues contain different amounts of water and the variation in water content could be used to help differentiate the various organs within the body. 00:02:50And so the  variation in water content could be used to help differentiate the various organs within the body. 00:02:50And so the MRI works by passing an electrical current through these coiled wires in the machine to create a temporary magnetic field in your body. 00:03:00And then a transmitter sends radio waves, and a receiver receives those radio waves and a computer uses those signals to make digital images of the scanned area of your body. 00:03:12So, the patient lies down inside this magnet here, and the radio wave antenna sends signals into the body and the receiver detects the signals and then that computer converts those signals to images. 00:03:28Here some of the basic elements of an MRI scanner, have a magnet, gradient coils and RF coils. 00:03:37And the computer controls the function of the gradient coils and the RF coils, and it receives and processes the signal from the RF coils, and turns that signal into an image that we can then interpret , and it receives and processes the signal from the RF coils, and turns that signal into an image that we can then interpret. 00:03:52[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com 7.6 Proton Alignment and Energy ReleaseEffects00:00:00[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:02So, Lecture 7.6, we're going to go a little more in depth about MRIs and talk about magnetic resonance imaging and the proton alignment and energy release that eventually leads to the ability to produce images. 00:00:16So our objectives for this lecture include being able to define longitudinal magnetization and identify the basic principles of MRI regarding the radiofrequency pulse, proton displacement, realignment, and the release of energy. 00:00:34Principles of MRI, alignment of protons and altering that alignment. 00:00:39The process of image acquisition begins by placing the patient in a scanner with an extremely strong magnetic field. 00:00:48There's a slight difference between the number of protons lining up parallel with the magnetic field and the number of photons lining up in the opposite direction. 00:00  of protons lining up parallel with the magnetic field and the number of photons lining up in the opposite direction. 00:00:57And this difference between the protons that line up parallel and those that line up in the opposite direction gives rise to net magnetization parallel with the external magnetic field, and that's referred to as longitudinal magnetization. 00:01:14Pulses of radiofrequency waves are then applied at right angles to that longitudinal magnetization. 00:01:21And these pulses of radiofrequency waves alter the alignment of the protons to a transverse plane. 00:01:28And the energy absorbed in that process brings those protons to a higher energy state. 00:01:35[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:38So looking at the bullet points, once inside a strong magnetic field, the protons line up either in the direction of the magnetic field. 00:01:46So in this case, 00:01:  line up either in the direction of the magnetic field. 00:01:46So in this case, 00:01:47[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:49In the direction of the magnetic field, here, or in the opposite of that direction. 00:01:57And the small difference in the number of protons aligned in these two directions is called the longitudinal magnetization. 00:02:06And then radiofrequency waves are applied at right angles to the alignment and the pulses alter the alignment of the protons to a new plane or orientation. 00:02:18So radiofrequency pulse sequence. 00:02:20A pulse sequence is a series of instructions that is repeated over and over to build up the data to create the magnetic resonance image. 00:02:30The spin echo sequence is a 90-degree pulse followed by a 180-degree pulse, after which, MRI signal is acquired from the protons. 00:02:40  followed by a 180-degree pulse, after which, MRI signal is acquired from the protons. 00:02:40This is how the T1 and T2 images are created. 00:02:44So these are different processes and they help the MRI differentiate between different tissue types and pathologies. 00:02:52So displacement and gradual realignment of protons. 00:02:56In this image, the protons are aligned with the main magnetic field in 1. 00:03:01And then when a radio frequency pulse is applied at right angles, as we see in number 2 here, this results in altered alignment of the protons, which is in 3, right? 00:03:12So initially they were kind of going this way and then it's like this and now they're going that way. 00:03:19And after that radiofrequency pulse stops, the protons gradually return to alignment. 00:03:25So they move from And after that radiofrequency pulse stops, the protons gradually return to alignment. 00:03:25So they move from pointing up that way, and they gradually start to rotate back down this way. 00:03:32And as they return to alignment with the magnetic field, they emit energy, and that energy that's emitted is measured. 00:03:42So we have the realignment of protons and decay. 00:03:45So after that radio frequency pulse ceases, as we saw in that last slide, right? 00:03:51In the last slide we had an alignment this way, and after the pulse stops, the alignment gradually begins to change into this direction, and the energy released as this change occurs here is measured. 00:04:09So the energy that they absorb from that pulse is released. 00:04:12That energy creates a current in a receiver coil. 00:04:16And the change in current results in the data 12That energy creates a current in a receiver coil. 00:04:16And the change in current results in the data, which creates an MR image. 00:04:20[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com 7.7 T1 and T2 Weighted Images00:00:01So, lecture 77 and this lecture is on magnetic resonance imaging, T1 weighted and T2 weighted images. 00:00:10And I briefly mentioned these in the past lecture. 00:00:15So our objectives for this lecture include at the end, you should be able to describe how protons returning to alignment with the magnetic field create T1 and T2 images. 00:00:27Should be able to define T1-weighted and T2-weighted images, including the differences between them. 00:00:33And finally, you should be able to identify which structures on MRI sequences show different signal intensities. 00:00:40On T1 versus T2- weighted images in general. 00:00:44So T1 and T2, the protons returned to alignment with a magnetic field and as they do that, they release energy. 00:00: , the protons returned to alignment with a magnetic field and as they do that, they release energy. 00:00:52So the protons realign with the magnetic field. 00:00:55And as they do that they gain longitudinal magnetization, but they lose their transverse magnetization. 00:01:03So my poor drawing skills here again, and the protons initially align that direction. 00:01:11And as they return to their original orientation, there's this release of energy. 00:01:20These are my energy lines as energy's released here, okay? 00:01:28[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:30So T1 recovery, the protons return to their longitudinal magnetization, right? 00:01:38And as they do that, they lose energy. 00:01:41Here's their energy lines again and the timing of the release of energy varies between tissues. 00:01:48  the right, the cerebrospinal fluid shows a high signal intensity. 00:08:38[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:40And with the exception of the degenerated L5S1 disc, so that's here. 00:08:45It's also a T1 image. 00:08:49The nuclei of the intervertebral disk gives rise to fairly high signal intensity so you can see the high signal intensity disc over here. 00:09:00Contrast that to the lower signal intensity on the T1 image it's important to note the anterior herniation of the L5-S1 disc, right? 00:09:12So the signal intensities from the adjacent area of bone edema and the L5-S1 vertebrae are different on T1 and T2. 00:09:22So the edema gives rise to increased signal intensity on the T2 image relative to the surrounding cancellous :09:22So the edema gives rise to increased signal intensity on the T2 image relative to the surrounding cancellous bone, whereas the same area in the T1 image stays dark. 00:09:36So, essentially, if we start on the T2 image and we look at that herniated region, we can see these brighter areas here, right? 00:09:43Which is indicative of more water content or edema. 00:09:47However, when we look at that same area on the right. 00:09:51Because this is going to stay dark with higher water content, we have that darker area. 00:09:56[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:02And this is a patient with rheumatoid arthritis, and so this is joint fluid, synovial hypertrophy, and this is fluid-filled erosions. 00:10:16And here we're looking at different muscles, , and this is fluid-filled erosions. 00:10:16And here we're looking at different muscles, we have the brachialis, triceps, and the capitulum of humerus, 00:10:24[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:27And the radial head [INAUDIBLE]. 00:10:34[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:10:37So, signal intensity is associated with inflammation and synovial hypertrophy and erosions in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis are displayed here, and the joint fluid is dark in the T1 image on the left. 00:10:53But bright in a T2 image on the right. 00:10:55Again, owing to that high water content. 00:10:59The synovial hypertrophy, and the fluid-filled joint erosion also give rise to low signal when less bright areas on a T-borne trophy, and the fluid-filled joint erosion also give rise to low signal when less bright areas on a T-borne image, but bright signal on T2. 00:11:10So this slice from the lateral aspect of the joint service the brachialis the triceps that could picture them of the humerus and the radial head, as I noted earlier. 00:11:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:11:27So here we're looking at the post laminectomy L4-5, and the top LS-4 is normal and on the bottom, the L5-S1 mortify muscle has been replaced by fat. 00:11:41And so we're looking at severe atrophy of the multifidus muscle following a laminectomy at the L4-5 level. 00:11:49The upper slice is made at the level of the L3-4 disc showing a normal appearance of the multifidus 49The upper slice is made at the level of the L3-4 disc showing a normal appearance of the multifidus muscle, the lower image is made at the level of the L5-S1 does. 00:12:01And you should notice that brighter multifidi and appearance of the mortify where much of the muscle substance has been replaced by fat. 00:12:11And so because this is a T1 image you can see that that fat is very bright. 00:12:18[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:12:25This is a pivot shift injury, and this is a T2 image on the right side. 00:12:30And there's bone bruising, and note the high signal intensity in the posterior medial tubial plateau. 00:12:38So this is a bone bruise in the medial tibial plateau of a young man who sustained a pivot shift injury while the knee was in a flexed position. 00  tibial plateau of a young man who sustained a pivot shift injury while the knee was in a flexed position. 00:12:47This resulted in compression of the medial side of the joint. 00:12:51A sagittal proton density image on the left shows a slightly altered trabecular pattern. 00:12:58In the posterior aspect of that medial tibial plateau. 00:13:02Now the T2 weighted image shows increase signal intensity within this part of the marrow. 00:13:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:24So, this is an image of a runner with an overuse injury and on the top. 00:13:28And we're looking at a T1 image and on the bottom a T2 image. 00:13:32[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:13:34And so the sagittal T1-weighted image top and the T2-weighted ] 00:13:34And so the sagittal T1-weighted image top and the T2-weighted image on the bottom demonstrates how bone marrow edema is represented and the different sequences because of their T1 versus T2 imaging. 00:13:48And the overuse injuries at the medial cuneiform, represented by the closed arrow and the navicular, which is the open arrow of a young runner, show decreased signal intensities, or dark areas, on the T1-weighted image. 00:14:01So, dark areas and we contrast that with the same area and the T2 image on the bottom. 00:14:11You can see the increased signal intensity or their brightness on the fluid sensitive T2-weighted image. 00:14:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:14:25T1 versus T2 summary, so T1 measures energy from structures which give up energy rapidly like fat after a radio 25T1 versus T2 summary, so T1 measures energy from structures which give up energy rapidly like fat after a radio-frequency pulse and T1 provides good anatomical detail. 00:14:39T2 images structures which do not give up energy easily like water, and T2 is valuable for detecting inflammation. 00:14:46So, because in T2-weighted imaging, the signal is measured late in the decay process, tissues that are most reluctant to give up energy are selectively imaged. 00:14:57Free water is slow to give up its energy, and therefore it renders a high signal intensity on T2 sequences. 00:15:05So, sat, which gives up its energy rapidly, gives rise to low signal on T2. 00:15:12[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:15:19T1 versus T2 summary continue. 00:15:24Fluid tends to be hyper intense to everything else on T 1 versus T2 summary continue. 00:15:24Fluid tends to be hyper intense to everything else on T2. 00:15:28Fat intensity can be unreliable because T2 images are sometimes manipulated and T1 images may use fat saturation to decrease signal from that. 00:15:38Air, cortical bone, ligaments, tendons, and other dense fibrous tissues are dark on both T1 and T2. 00:15:46T2 is valuable for detecting inflammation. 00:15:49[BLANK_AUDIO] cielo24 | what’s in your video? | cielo24.com :41Here's their energy lines again and the timing of the release of energy varies between tissues. 00:01:48And so the faster the return to alignment with the magnetization. 00:01:52So the faster they move from here to here, the stronger the signal from the photons in that tissue. 00:02:02So stronger. 00:02:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:08The signal, so the protons are turning back or realigning to orient themselves in the direction of the charge and longitudinal magnetization 00:02:17[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:20T2 decay, as opposed to the prior slide of T1 recovery, T2 decay is decay of transverse magnetization as the protons realign. 00:02:31So the slower the decay of the transverse magnetization, the stronger the signal that is recorded at the end of this process. 00:02:39  the transverse magnetization, the stronger the signal that is recorded at the end of this process. 00:02:39And because much of the energy has been released by the protons, T2 images are grainier and display less spatial resolution. 00:02:48So T1-weighted images are created primarily by using data from differential proton relaxation rates and the plane longitudinal. 00:02:57[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:02:59To the main magnetic field. 00:03:02The T2-weighted images primarily make use of data from differential proton relaxation rates and the plain transverse to the main magnetic field. 00:03:14[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:17In other words, essentially what we're saying is how slowly do these protons realign and how reluctant are they to release the energy they stored up from being bumped by the radio frequency signal. 00:03:32So a  are they to release the energy they stored up from being bumped by the radio frequency signal. 00:03:32So a T1 weighted imaging and you can see table 5.1 in your McKinnis text. 00:03:37The signal is caught early, and the tissues that rapidly recover that longitudinal magnetization create a highly intense signal. 00:03:47So fat, for example, rapidly recovers longitudinal magnetization. 00:03:52Tissues that recover longitudinal magnetization more slowly, create a low signal intensity like water. 00:04:00So you should remember that fat recovers longitudinal magnetization quickly and therefore fat creates a highly intense signal on T1 imaging. 00:04:11So T1 imaging is characterized by short time to repetition. 00:04:16And the signal is caught early at a time when the difference in relaxation characteristics for fat and water is most noticeable, right? 00:04:24So again remember that that's going to  relaxation characteristics for fat and water is most noticeable, right? 00:04:24So again remember that that's going to be highly intense on T1 and water is going to be very dark 21 days. 00:04:32And so at that time, the tissues that rapidly recover that longitudinal magnetization such as fat, give out that high signal intensity and create a bright image. 00:04:45And so when a short time to echo is employed, the tissues that are slow to regain that longitudinal magnetization. 00:04:53Such as those that high water content have a really low signal intensity and those tissues appeared dark on T1-weighted images. 00:05:02So remember your T1. 00:05:04[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:06Fat is bright, that's a B. 00:05:10[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:13That's sort of a cheat. 00: :05:10[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:13That's sort of a cheat. 00:05:14And water. 00:05:15[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:17Is. 00:05:18[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:20Dark. 00:05:22[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:05:26So T2 weighted imaging, again, you can refer to table 5-1 in your McKinnis text, the signal is caught late in the decay and the return to alignment process. 00:05:37So the tissues which are slowest to return to alignment, the slowest to give up the energy, those create the high signal intensity. 00:05:46So water is slow to give up energy therefore, the T2 high intensity signals come mostly from water. 00:05:54So if we use my sort of bad drawing arrow examples again  high intensity signals come mostly from water. 00:05:54So if we use my sort of bad drawing arrow examples again, right? 00:05:58We have this alignment here. 00:06:01And as that alignment changes the energy is given off here. 00:06:09So in the T2, right? 00:06:11We're looking at a slow change. 00:06:16And so what we're going to see is because in the T2-weighted imaging, the signals measured really late in the decay process because it's moving really slowly. 00:06:27The tissues that are the most reluctant to give up energy are going to be selectively imaged and are going to be the brightest. 00:06:34And so water's going to give up its energy slowly, and as a result, it's going to image with a really high signal intensity on a T2 sequence. 00:06:45So, instead  it's going to image with a really high signal intensity on a T2 sequence. 00:06:45So, instead, the prior slide, fat is going to give up its energy rapidly. 00:06:55And as a result on T2 imaging, it's burning fat. 00:06:59It's going to give rise to a low intensity signal and show up darker. 00:07:03So on T2 as opposed to T1, water is bright and fat, dark, okay? 00:07:21[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:26So T1 versus T2 MR imaging. 00:07:30Fat creates a high signal intensity on T1. 00:07:34Fat is bright on T1, and water creates a high signal intensity on T2. 00:07:40Water is bright T2, so in the T1 image on the left here, the bone marrow gives rise to relatively high signal  is bright T2, so in the T1 image on the left here, the bone marrow gives rise to relatively high signal intensity, and the cerebrospinal fluid gives rise to low signal intensity. 00:07:55It's black in the image, and the intervertebral discs are also dark. 00:08:01Also, note the intermediate signal intensity of the spinal cord and contrasted with the cerebrospinal fluid. 00:08:09So, again, you can see this is dark and this is dark. 00:08:17Okay, and you can also see that this. 00:08:20[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:24Are relatively bright compared to the disks. 00:08:26[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:29Now, in the T2 image on the right, the cerebrospinal fluid shows a high signal intensity. 00:08:38[BLANK_AUD
