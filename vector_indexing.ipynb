       "\"1.2  The Low Back and Lower Extremities; Regional Pain Patterns and Associated Disorders00:00:01Lecture 1.2, regional pain patterns and associated diseases and disorders, low back and lower extremities. 00:00:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:00:12So the objectives here are to identify 4 forms you might give to a patient with low back pain to provide additional information about that patient's condition. 00:00:23Describe at least two non-musculoskeletal causes of low back pain and under what circumstances you might reevaluate a musculoskeletal cause of labaquine. 00:00:34Describe symptoms which might lead you to include cauda equina in your list of differential diagnoses. 00:00:42Identify five potentially serious conditions which may mimic less serious musculoskeletal conditions in the pelvis, hip, and thigh. 00:00:52And finally, identify five potentially serious conditions which may mimic less serious musculoskeletal conditions in the knee, lower leg, ankle, and foot. 00:01:03[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:01:06Low back pain questionnaires and forms. 00:01:09So some of these forms include the modified oswestry low back pain disability questionnaire. 00:01:15Usually you'll see that abbreviated and this is an outcome measure. 00:01:18Another one is the Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire. 00:01:21Again, this is usually abbreviated FABQ. 00:01:26Common Medical History Intake Forms, and then finally a Red Flag Screening Form could be included, and we'll learn more about these as the class progresses. 00:01:36So a patient with low back pain presenting to your clinic may be given multiple forms to fill out to try and obtain as much useful information about the case as possible. 00:01:48Low back pain, cause of pain. 00:01:51If a patient is over 55 and is failing to improve, it may be appropriate to consider non musculoskeletal causes of the low back pain. 00:02:00Or, it may be appropriate to inquire about an infection as the cause of the patient's low back pain. 00:02:07If the patient notes that their comfort does not change in any position, the likelihood that the pain is not musculoskeletal in origin increases. 00:02:17So asking the patient about a history of trauma, osteoporosis, or other disorder that may decrease bone density may help you rule out spinal fracture as a cause of the patient's pain. 00:02:30So a physical therapist asks the 55 year old patient the following questions to increase or decrease, there's suspicion that this patient's low back pain is caused by cancer. 00:02:42Do you have a history of cancer? 00:02:44If so, what type of cancer? 00:02:47Have you recently lost weight, even though you have not been attempting to eat less or exercise more? 00:02:52If you have, how much weight have you lost? 00:02:55When asking about infection, questions such as, have you recently had a fever? 00:03:00Or have you recently taken antibiotics for an infection or have you been diagnosed with an immunosuppressive disorder can all provide you with useful information. 00:03:09[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:14Cauda equina, to rule out cauda equina, asking about changes in bowel or bladder habits as well as saddle paresthesia and lower extremity weakness can be useful. 00:03:26A positive response to any of these questions increases the suspicion that the patient has cauda equina syndrome. 00:03:33You can follow these inquiries with a physical examination assessing sensory integrity of the perianal and perineal areas, as well as the L4, 5, and S1 dermatomes. 00:03:45You can also assess motor integrity of L4, the quadriceps and tibialis anterior or L5 and S1 musculature. 00:03:54[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:03:59Pelvis, hip and thigh. 00:04:02Colon cancer, femoral neck fracture, osteonecrosis, Legg-Calve-Perthes, and slipped capital femoral epiphysis can all mimic common musculoskeletal disorders of the pelvis, hip and thigh. 00:04:17In older populations, proximal femur fractures become increasingly likely. 00:04:22Patient demographics, age, sex, etc, and a detailed health history are important. 00:04:28Medications affecting bone density are also important screening components. 00:04:33Leg calf perthes is most common in 5-8 year old boys and they often report groin, thigh and knee pain that worsens with weight bearing activities. 00:04:43Slip capital femoral epiphysis occurs in adolescents and 2-1 in boys vs girls. 00:04:51Symptoms include groin, thigh or knee pain and limited hip internal rotation range of motion. 00:04:58Pathologic fractures of the femoral neck occur secondary to disease and often in the absence of major trauma. 00:05:05These fractures are most common in individuals over 50 years, women more often than men, and patients who have a history of metabolic bone disease, such as osteoporosis or Paget's disease. 00:05:18A history of a fall from a standing position is often reported, along with a feeling of a sudden painful snap in the hip region and giving way. 00:05:26Acute groin pain is usually reported. 00:05:30In Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, this condition results from an idiopathic loss of blood supply From the lateral ascending cervical artery to the femoral head. 00:05:40Patients with osteonecrosis and Legg-Calve-Perthes disease often report pain in the groin, thigh, and knee that worsens with weight-bearing activities resulting in an antalgic gait. 00:05:52Common clinical findings in children with Legg-Calve-Perthes disease also include shortening of the involved leg. 00:05:59Unlimited internal rotation and abduction of the involved hip. 00:06:02[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:06:06Knee, lower leg, ankle and foot and deep vein thrombosis. 00:06:13Compartment syndrome deep vein thrombosis, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, septic arthritis, and cellulitis, are all serious conditions to consider in this region, in this region being the knee, lower leg ankle and foot. 00:06:30Peripheral vascular disease often includes aching and buttock thigh and calf that increases with activity and improves with rest. 00:06:39A DVT may manifest as calf pain that increases with activity, but half of DVT patients do not experience calf pain. 00:06:48Risk factors for DVT include recent surgery, malignancy, trauma, prolonged immobilization and pregnancy. 00:06:57Peripheral vascular disease. 00:06:59Usually can be sussed out by looking at pedal pulses and whether they're decreased and also looking for wounds and sores on the toes or feet of patients. 00:07:08[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:07:12Continuing with knee, lower leg, ankle, and foot, compartment syndrome. 00:07:16Compartment syndrome is a result of swelling inside a connective tissue compartment. 00:07:21Usually it's a result of trauma or a rapid increase in physical activity. 00:07:26Symptoms of compartment syndrome include pain when a stretch is applied to the involved muscle. 00:07:32Keep in mind the six Ps of compartment syndrome, pain, palpable tenderness, paraesthesia, paresis, pallor, and pulselessness. 00:07:42So, with compartment syndrome the physical examination typically reveals swelling, tenderness and palpable tension of the involved compartment. 00:07:52The nerve entrapment or compression found in this condition results in paresthesias, and potentially in paralysis. 00:07:59The vascular compromise accompanying this condition results in diminished peripheral pulses and, potentially, a change in skin color. 00:08:07[BLANK_AUDIO] 00:08:14Finally, septic arthritis and cellulitis continuing in the knee, lower leg, ankle, and foot. 00:08:19Septic arthritis is an inflammation in a joint caused by a bacterial infection. 00:08:24Cellulitis is an infection in the skin after a wound becomes contaminated by bacteria. 00:08:30Patients who have septic arthritis complain of a constant aching or throbbing pain and a swelling in a joint. 00:08:37The involved joint is usually tender and warm when palpated. 00:08:40And depending on which joint is involved, erythema may be present. 00:08:44Patients who develop septic arthritis often are immunosuppressed or have pre-existing systemic joint disease. 00:08:54An infection in the tissues, cellulitis, exhibits the classic signs of pain, skin swelling, warmth. 00:09:01And advancing irregular margin of erythema or reddish streaks, suspicion of either septic
